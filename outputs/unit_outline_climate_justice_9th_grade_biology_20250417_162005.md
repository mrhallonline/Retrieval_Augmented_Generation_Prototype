## Unit Title: Climate Justice and Local Impact

### Anchoring Phenomenon
The disproportionate impact of climate change on Chicago's South Side communities, particularly focusing on increased flooding and heatwaves.

### Driving Question
How can we use science and community action to address climate justice issues in our local neighborhoods?

### Introduction
On the first day, students will explore a recent news story about a severe flooding event in a South Side neighborhood. This will be followed by a discussion on personal experiences with climate-related events in their communities. Students will be encouraged to share stories from their families and neighbors, connecting personal and community experiences to the broader topic of climate justice.

### Storyline Arc Summary
The unit begins with students examining the localized effects of climate change, such as flooding and heatwaves, in Chicago. They will investigate the scientific principles behind these phenomena, including weather patterns, greenhouse gases, and urban heat islands. As students progress, they will explore the concept of climate justice, focusing on how marginalized communities are disproportionately affected. The unit will incorporate data analysis and engineering practices as students design solutions to mitigate these impacts. Throughout, students will engage with community members and local organizations to understand ongoing efforts and develop their own action plans. The unit culminates in a community presentation where students propose solutions and advocate for policy changes.

### Lesson Sets
1. **Understanding Climate Change Basics**: Students will learn about the greenhouse effect, weather vs. climate, and the role of human activities in climate change. They will analyze data on temperature changes and CO2 levels.
   
2. **Local Climate Impacts**: This lesson focuses on the specific impacts of climate change in Chicago, such as increased flooding and heatwaves. Students will examine case studies and use GIS tools to map vulnerable areas.

3. **Exploring Climate Justice**: Students will investigate how climate change disproportionately affects marginalized communities. They will study historical and current examples of environmental injustice and discuss the concept of equity in climate action.

4. **Engineering Solutions**: In this lesson, students will apply engineering practices to design solutions for mitigating local climate impacts. They will work in teams to develop prototypes and test their effectiveness.

5. **Community Engagement and Action**: Students will connect with local organizations and community leaders to learn about ongoing climate action efforts. They will develop and present their own action plans to address climate justice issues in their neighborhoods.

### Notes on Integrating Cultivating Genius
- **Identity**: Encourage students to explore their own cultural backgrounds and how these influence their perspectives on climate justice.
- **Skill**: Develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills through data analysis and engineering practices.
- **Intellect**: Build knowledge of climate science and justice issues, emphasizing the importance of informed action.
- **Criticality**: Foster an understanding of power dynamics and social justice, encouraging students to advocate for change.

### NGSS Performance Expectations
- HS-ESS3-1: Construct an explanation based on evidence for how the availability of natural resources, occurrence of natural hazards, and climate change have influenced human activity.
- HS-ESS3-4: Evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces impacts of human activities on natural systems.
- HS-ETS1-2: Design a solution to a complex real-world problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable problems that can be solved through engineering.

### Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts
- How effectively did students connect the scientific concepts to their personal and community experiences?
- In what ways did students demonstrate growth in understanding climate justice?
- How did the unit foster a sense of agency and empowerment among students?
