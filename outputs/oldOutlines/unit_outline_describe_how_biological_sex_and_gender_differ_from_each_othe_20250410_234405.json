  "title": "Unraveling the Complexities: Biological Sex, Gender, and Genetic Mutations",
  "phenomenon": "The observable differences in athletic performance between individuals of different biological sexes, and the influence of genetic mutations on the development of sex characteristics.",
  "driving_question": "How do biological sex and gender differ, and how do genetic mutations affect the development of internal and external sex characteristics and athletic performance?",
  "summary": "The unit begins by exploring the concepts of biological sex and gender, emphasizing their differences and the societal and cultural implications of each. Students will then delve into the genetics behind biological sex, studying the role of chromosomes and genes. The unit will then shift to the exploration of genetic mutations and their potential effects on the development of sex characteristics. Students will investigate real-world examples of how these mutations can influence athletic performance. The unit will conclude with a discussion on the implications of these genetic influences on societal norms and expectations, particularly in the context of their rural community.",
