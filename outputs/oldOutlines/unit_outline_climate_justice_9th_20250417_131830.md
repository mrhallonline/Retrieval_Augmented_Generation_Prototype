## Unit Title: Climate Justice in Chicago: Understanding and Acting on Local Impacts

### Anchoring Phenomenon
The disproportionate impact of climate change on marginalized communities in Chicago, particularly in neighborhoods with higher pollution levels and less green space.

### Driving Question
How can we, as informed citizens, advocate for climate justice in our local communities?

### Introduction
On the first day, students will engage with a multimedia presentation showcasing the effects of climate change in various Chicago neighborhoods. They will examine local news reports, interviews with community activists, and data on air quality and green space distribution. This will help students connect the global issue of climate change to their local environment and personal experiences.

### Storyline Arc Summary
This unit will guide students through an exploration of climate justice, focusing on how climate change disproportionately affects marginalized communities in Chicago. Students will begin by examining local data on pollution and green space, then explore the science behind climate change and its impacts. They will engage in discussions about social justice and equity, and learn about local initiatives and policies aimed at addressing these issues. Throughout the unit, students will develop skills in data analysis, critical thinking, and advocacy. The unit will culminate in a project where students propose actionable solutions to promote climate justice in their communities.

### Lesson Sets

1. **Understanding Local Climate Impacts**: Students will analyze data on air quality and green space in different Chicago neighborhoods, identifying patterns and disparities. They will discuss how these factors contribute to climate vulnerability.

2. **The Science of Climate Change**: This lesson will cover the basics of climate science, including the greenhouse effect, carbon emissions, and global warming. Students will conduct experiments to visualize these concepts.

3. **Social Justice and Climate Change**: Students will explore the concept of environmental justice, examining case studies of communities affected by climate change. They will discuss the intersection of race, class, and environmental policy.

4. **Local Initiatives and Advocacy**: This lesson will highlight local efforts to combat climate change, such as community gardens and clean energy projects. Students will learn about advocacy strategies and how to engage with policymakers.

5. **Creating a Climate Justice Action Plan**: In the final lesson, students will work in groups to develop an action plan for promoting climate justice in their community. They will present their plans to the class and receive feedback.
