## Unit Title: Climate Justice: Empowering Change in Chicago

### Anchoring Phenomenon
The disproportionate impact of urban heat islands and air pollution in predominantly Black and LatinX neighborhoods in Chicago.

### Driving Question
How can we use science and engineering to address climate justice issues in our community?

### Introduction
On the first day, students will explore their local neighborhood through a virtual or physical walk, documenting evidence of urban heat islands and air pollution. They will collect data using temperature sensors and air quality monitors, setting the stage for understanding how these environmental issues affect their community. This hands-on experience will connect students to the phenomenon by highlighting real-world problems they encounter daily.

### Storyline Arc Summary
The unit begins with students identifying climate justice issues in their community, focusing on urban heat islands and air pollution. They will investigate the science behind these phenomena, learning about the greenhouse effect, energy transfer, and the role of human activities. Through data collection and analysis, students will assess the impact of these issues on health and the environment. They will explore engineering solutions, such as green roofs and urban greening, and evaluate their feasibility in their neighborhoods. The unit culminates in a community presentation where students propose actionable solutions to local stakeholders, empowering them to advocate for change.

### Lesson Sets
1. **Understanding Urban Heat Islands**: Students will learn about the causes and effects of urban heat islands, using temperature data collected from their neighborhoods to identify hotspots.
2. **Air Quality and Health**: This lesson focuses on air pollution sources and its health impacts. Students will analyze air quality data and discuss how pollution disproportionately affects marginalized communities.
3. **The Science of Climate Change**: Students will explore the greenhouse effect and energy transfer, connecting these concepts to the local climate issues they observe.
4. **Engineering Solutions for Climate Justice**: Students will investigate engineering solutions like green roofs and urban greening, evaluating their potential to mitigate local climate issues.
5. **Community Advocacy and Action**: In the final lesson, students will prepare presentations to propose their solutions to local stakeholders, practicing advocacy and communication skills.

- **Skill**: Develop scientific inquiry, data analysis, and communication skills.
- **Intellect**: Foster critical thinking about the intersection of science, society, and justice.
- **Criticality**: Empower students to recognize and challenge systemic inequities in environmental policies.

### NGSS Performance Expectations
- HS-ESS3-1: Construct an explanation based on evidence for how the availability of natural resources, occurrence of natural hazards, and climate change have influenced human activity.
- HS-ESS3-4: Evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces impacts of human activities on natural systems.
- HS-ETS1-3: Evaluate a solution to a complex real-world problem based on prioritized criteria and trade-offs.

### Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts
- How did students connect their personal experiences to the climate justice issues discussed?
- What challenges did students face in proposing solutions, and how did they overcome them?
- How did the unit foster a sense of empowerment and advocacy among students?
