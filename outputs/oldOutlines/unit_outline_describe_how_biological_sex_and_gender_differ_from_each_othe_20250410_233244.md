1. Title of the Unit: "Unraveling the Complexities: Biological Sex, Gender, and Genetic Mutations"

2. NGSS Anchoring Phenomenon: The observable differences in athletic performance between individuals of different biological sexes and the influence of genetic mutations on the development of sex characteristics.

3. Driving Question: How do biological sex, gender, and genetic mutations influence our physical characteristics and abilities, and how can this understanding contribute to a more inclusive and fair society?

4. Summary of the Storyline Arc: The unit begins by exploring the concepts of biological sex and gender, highlighting the differences and the cultural implications of both. Students then delve into the role of genes and chromosomes in determining biological sex, and how mutations can affect the development of sex characteristics. The unit then shifts to the influence of these factors on athletic performance, using real-world examples and data. Students will engage in discussions and activities that promote inclusivity and understanding of gender diversity. The unit concludes with students applying their knowledge to propose ways to make athletic competitions more fair and inclusive, considering both biological and gender differences.

5. Lesson Sets:
   - Lesson Set 1: Introduction to Biological Sex and Gender: Students explore the concepts of biological sex and gender, and how they differ. They also discuss the cultural implications and perceptions of both.
   - Lesson Set 2: Genetics and Biological Sex: Students delve into the role of genes and chromosomes in determining biological sex, using models and diagrams.
   - Lesson Set 3: Genetic Mutations and Sex Characteristics: Students investigate how genetic mutations can affect the development of sex characteristics, using case studies and data analysis.
   - Lesson Set 4: Biological Sex, Gender, and Athletic Performance: Students analyze real-world data to understand how biological sex and gender can influence athletic performance.
   - Lesson Set 5: Promoting Inclusivity in Athletics: Students apply their knowledge to propose ways to make athletic competitions more fair and inclusive, considering both biological and gender differences.

6. Key Investigations:
   - Investigation 1: Exploring the Role of Genes and Chromosomes in Determining Biological Sex
   - Investigation 2: Analyzing the Impact of Genetic Mutations on Sex Characteristics
   - Investigation 3: Examining the Influence of Biological Sex and Gender on Athletic Performance

7. NGSS Performance Expectations: 
   - HS-LS1-4: Use a model to illustrate the role of cellular division (mitosis) and differentiation in producing and maintaining complex organisms.
   - HS-LS3-1: Ask questions to clarify relationships about the role of DNA and chromosomes in coding the instructions for characteristic traits passed from parents to offspring.
   - HS-LS3-2: Make and defend a claim based on evidence that inheritable genetic variations may result from: (1) new genetic combinations through meiosis, (2) viable errors occurring during replication, and/or (3) mutations caused by environmental factors.

8. Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts:
   - How did students' understanding of the difference between biological sex and gender evolve throughout the unit?
   - In what ways did students apply their understanding of genetics to explain the development of sex characteristics?
   - How effectively did students use data to analyze the influence of biological sex and gender on athletic performance?
   - How did students demonstrate their understanding of inclusivity and fairness in their proposals for more equitable athletic competitions?
