## Unit Title: Climate Justice in Chicago: Understanding and Action

### Anchoring Phenomenon
The disproportionate impact of urban heat islands and air pollution in Chicago's South and West Side neighborhoods.

### Driving Question
How can we use our understanding of biology and environmental science to promote climate justice in our community?

### Introduction
On the first day, students will engage in a walking tour of their neighborhood or a virtual exploration using maps and data to observe and document signs of urban heat islands and air pollution. They will be introduced to the concept of climate justice and discuss how these environmental issues disproportionately affect certain communities in Chicago.

### Storyline Arc Summary
This unit will guide students through an exploration of climate justice, focusing on how biological and environmental science concepts can be applied to understand and address local environmental issues. Students will begin by investigating the science behind urban heat islands and air pollution, using Chicago as a case study. They will analyze data, engage in hands-on experiments, and explore the social and political dimensions of climate change. Throughout the unit, students will develop a project aimed at proposing solutions to mitigate the impacts of these phenomena in their own communities. By the end of the unit, students will present their findings and action plans to local stakeholders, demonstrating their understanding of the interconnectedness of science, society, and justice.

### Lesson Sets
1. **Introduction to Climate Justice**: Students explore the concept of climate justice, focusing on how climate change impacts different communities unequally. They will analyze case studies from Chicago and other urban areas.
   
2. **Urban Heat Islands**: This lesson focuses on the science of urban heat islands. Students will conduct experiments to understand how different materials absorb heat and analyze temperature data from various neighborhoods in Chicago.
   
3. **Air Pollution and Health**: Students investigate the sources and effects of air pollution, particularly in urban settings. They will use data to examine the correlation between pollution levels and health outcomes in different Chicago neighborhoods.
   
4. **Community Impact and Action**: Students will learn about local initiatives and organizations working towards climate justice. They will engage with guest speakers and participate in discussions about community-led solutions.
   
5. **Project Development and Presentation**: In this culminating lesson, students will develop and present their projects aimed at addressing climate justice issues in their communities. They will receive feedback from peers and local stakeholders.

### Notes on Integrating Cultivating Genius
- **Identity**: Encourage students to reflect on their personal connections to the environmental issues discussed.
- **Skill**: Develop scientific inquiry and data analysis skills through hands-on activities and experiments.
- **Intellect**: Foster critical thinking by analyzing the intersection of science and social justice.
- **Criticality**: Engage students in discussions about power, privilege, and the role of activism in addressing climate change.

### NGSS Performance Expectations
- HS-ESS3-1: Construct an explanation based on evidence for how the availability of natural resources, occurrence of natural hazards, and climate change have influenced human activity.
- HS-ESS3-4: Evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces impacts of human activities on natural systems.
- HS-LS2-7: Design, evaluate, and refine a solution for reducing the impacts of human activities on the environment and biodiversity.

### Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts
- How did students engage with the concept of climate justice?
- What challenges did students face in connecting scientific concepts to social issues?
- How can I further support students in developing their projects and presentations?
