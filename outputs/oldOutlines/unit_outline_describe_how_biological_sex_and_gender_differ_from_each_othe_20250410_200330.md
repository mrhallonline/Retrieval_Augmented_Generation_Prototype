1. Title of the Unit: "Understanding Biological Sex, Gender, and Genetic Mutations: Their Role in Human Development and Athletic Performance"

2. NGSS Anchoring Phenomenon: The variation in athletic performance among individuals of different biological sexes and the impact of genetic mutations on the development of sex characteristics.

3. Driving Question: How do biological sex and gender differ, and how do mutations in certain genes affect the development of internal and external sex characteristics and athletic performance?

4. Summary of the Storyline Arc: The unit begins with an exploration of the concepts of biological sex and gender, highlighting their differences and societal implications. Students then delve into the role of genes in determining biological sex and the development of sex characteristics, using real-world examples from their community and popular culture. The unit progresses to examine the impact of genetic mutations on these characteristics and how they can influence athletic performance. Students will conduct investigations, analyze data, and engage in discussions that challenge stereotypes and promote inclusivity. The unit concludes with a reflection on the importance of understanding these concepts in promoting fairness in sports and broader societal contexts.

5. Lesson Sets:
   - Lesson Set 1: Introduction to Biological Sex and Gender: This lesson introduces the concepts of biological sex and gender, their differences, and societal implications.
   - Lesson Set 2: Role of Genes in Sex Determination: This lesson explores the role of genes in determining biological sex and the development of sex characteristics.
   - Lesson Set 3: Impact of Genetic Mutations: Students learn about how mutations in certain genes can affect the development of internal and external sex characteristics.
   - Lesson Set 4: Genetic Mutations and Athletic Performance: This lesson investigates how characteristics associated with biological sex can influence athletic performance.
   - Lesson Set 5: Reflection and Discussion: This lesson encourages students to reflect on their learning and engage in discussions that challenge stereotypes and promote inclusivity.

6. Key Investigations:
   - Investigation 1: Exploring Biological Sex and Gender: Students research and present on the concepts of biological sex and gender in different cultures.
   - Investigation 2: Genes and Sex Determination: Students use models to illustrate the role of genes in determining biological sex.
   - Investigation 3: Genetic Mutations and Sex Characteristics: Students analyze case studies to understand the impact of genetic mutations on the development of sex characteristics.
   - Investigation 4: Athletic Performance and Biological Sex: Students analyze data on athletic performance among individuals of different biological sexes.

7. NGSS Performance Expectations: HS-LS1-4, HS-LS3-1, HS-LS3-2

8. Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts:
   - How did students respond to the discussions on biological sex and gender? 
   - Were students able to understand the role of genes and genetic mutations in determining sex characteristics and influencing athletic performance?
   - How effectively did the unit challenge stereotypes and promote inclusivity?
   - How can the unit be improved to better reflect students' cultural identities and community experiences?
