  "summary": "Students will begin the unit by examining temperature and air quality data from different neighborhoods in Chicago. They will explore how these environmental factors vary across the city and discuss why certain areas are more affected than others. This localized phenomenon will serve as a springboard for understanding the broader concepts of climate justice and environmental equity. This unit will guide students through an exploration of climate justice, focusing on the local context of Chicago. Students will start by analyzing data on urban heat islands and air pollution, identifying patterns and disparities among neighborhoods. They will investigate the causes of these disparities, including historical redlining and industrial zoning practices. As students develop a deeper understanding of the science behind climate change and its social implications, they will engage in engineering practices to propose solutions that mitigate these effects. Throughout the unit, students will connect their learning to local initiatives and consider how they can contribute to climate action in their communities. The unit will culminate in a project where students design and present actionable plans to promote climate justice in Chicago.",
