## Title of the Unit
**Climate Justice: Understanding and Acting on Local Impacts**

## Anchoring Phenomenon
**Localized Flooding in Chicago Neighborhoods Due to Climate Change**

## Driving Question
**How can we understand and address the impacts of climate change on our local communities to promote climate justice?**

## Introduction
On the first day, students will be introduced to the concept of climate justice through a case study of recent flooding events in Chicago neighborhoods. They will explore how these events disproportionately affect certain communities and discuss the role of science and engineering in developing solutions. This will set the stage for understanding the broader implications of climate change and the importance of equitable solutions.

## Storyline Arc Summary
This unit begins with students exploring the localized phenomenon of flooding in Chicago, which serves as a tangible example of climate change impacts. They will investigate the science behind climate change, focusing on the greenhouse effect and human activities that contribute to global warming. As students delve deeper, they will analyze data on local weather patterns and socio-economic factors that exacerbate the effects of climate change on marginalized communities. The unit will incorporate engineering practices as students design potential solutions to mitigate flooding in their neighborhoods. Throughout the unit, students will engage with Muhammadâ€™s Cultivating Genius framework, reflecting on their identities, developing critical thinking skills, and understanding the socio-political dimensions of climate change. The unit culminates in a community action project where students propose and present solutions to local stakeholders.

## Lesson Sets
1. **Introduction to Climate Change and Justice**
   - Students will explore the basic science of climate change and its global and local impacts. They will discuss the concept of climate justice and how it relates to equity and fairness in addressing environmental issues.

2. **Investigating Local Climate Impacts**
   - This lesson focuses on analyzing data related to Chicago's weather patterns and flooding incidents. Students will learn to interpret data and understand the role of human activities in exacerbating climate impacts.

3. **Engineering Solutions for Flood Mitigation**
   - Students will engage in engineering practices to design solutions for reducing flooding in their communities. They will work in teams to brainstorm, prototype, and test their ideas, considering both scientific and socio-economic factors.

4. **Cultural and Community Perspectives**
   - In this lesson, students will explore how different communities in Chicago experience and respond to climate change. They will learn from local activists and community leaders about ongoing efforts and challenges.

5. **Action and Advocacy**
   - The final lesson focuses on empowering students to take action. They will develop and present proposals for community-based solutions to local stakeholders, incorporating feedback and reflecting on their learning journey.

## Notes on Integrating Cultivating Genius
- **Identity**: Encourage students to explore their personal connections to climate issues and reflect on their roles as change-makers.
- **Skill**: Develop critical thinking and data analysis skills through hands-on investigations and problem-solving activities.
- **Intellect**: Foster a deep understanding of scientific concepts and socio-political contexts related to climate change.
- **Criticality**: Empower students to recognize and challenge inequities in climate impacts and advocate for justice.

## NGSS Performance Expectations
- HS-ESS3-1: Construct an explanation based on evidence for how the availability of natural resources, occurrence of natural hazards, and changes in climate have influenced human activity.
- HS-ESS3-4: Evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces impacts of human activities on natural systems.
- HS-ETS1-2: Design a solution to a complex real-world problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable problems that can be solved through engineering.

## Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts
- How did students engage with the concept of climate justice?
- What challenges did students face in understanding the socio-economic dimensions of climate change?
- How effectively did students collaborate on engineering solutions?
- In what ways did the unit foster a sense of agency and empowerment among students?
