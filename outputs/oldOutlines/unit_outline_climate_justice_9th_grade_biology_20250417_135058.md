## Unit Title: Climate Justice: Understanding and Acting on Local Impacts

### Anchoring Phenomenon
The disproportionate impact of climate change on marginalized communities in Chicago, particularly focusing on increased flooding and heatwaves in neighborhoods with less green space and infrastructure.

### Driving Question
How can we address the impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities in Chicago to promote climate justice?

### Introduction
On the first day, students will engage with a multimedia presentation showcasing real stories and data about climate change impacts in Chicago neighborhoods. This will include interviews with local residents and community leaders, highlighting personal experiences with flooding and heatwaves. Students will reflect on how these issues relate to their own lives and communities, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of climate justice.

### Storyline Arc Summary
The unit begins by introducing students to the concept of climate justice and its importance in addressing the unequal impacts of climate change. Students will explore local data on climate impacts in Chicago, analyzing how factors such as socioeconomic status and infrastructure contribute to vulnerability. Through a series of investigations, students will engage in scientific practices to understand the mechanisms of climate change and its local effects. They will then explore engineering solutions and social actions that can mitigate these impacts, culminating in a project where they propose a community-based plan to address climate justice issues. Throughout the unit, students will develop their understanding of climate science while considering cultural and social dimensions, empowering them to become informed advocates for their communities.

### Lesson Sets
1. **Introduction to Climate Justice**
   - Students explore the concept of climate justice and its relevance to their lives. They analyze case studies of Chicago neighborhoods affected by climate change, discussing the social and environmental factors at play.

2. **Understanding Climate Change Mechanisms**
   - This lesson focuses on the scientific principles behind climate change, including greenhouse gases and global warming. Students conduct experiments to visualize these concepts and analyze local climate data.

3. **Impact Analysis: Local Case Studies**
   - Students dive into specific case studies of Chicago neighborhoods, using data to assess the impacts of climate change. They explore how infrastructure and policy decisions contribute to these impacts.

4. **Engineering Solutions for Climate Resilience**
   - In this lesson, students investigate engineering solutions that can mitigate climate impacts, such as green roofs and improved drainage systems. They engage in design thinking to propose solutions for their own communities.

5. **Social Action and Advocacy**
   - The final lesson focuses on social and political actions that can promote climate justice. Students learn about local advocacy efforts and develop their own action plans to engage with community leaders and policymakers.

- **Skill**: Develop skills in scientific inquiry, data analysis, and engineering design.
- **Intellect**: Foster critical thinking about the intersection of science, society, and policy.
- **Criticality**: Empower students to recognize and challenge social injustices related to climate change, promoting agency and advocacy.

### NGSS Performance Expectations
- HS-ESS3-1: Construct an explanation based on evidence for how the availability of natural resources, occurrence of natural hazards, and climate change have influenced human activity.
- HS-ESS3-4: Evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces impacts of human activities on natural systems.
- HS-ETS1-3: Evaluate a solution to a complex real-world problem based on prioritized criteria and trade-offs.

### Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts
