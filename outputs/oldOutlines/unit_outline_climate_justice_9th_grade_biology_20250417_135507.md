## Title of the Unit
**Climate Justice in Chicago: Understanding and Acting on Local and Global Impacts**

## Anchoring Phenomenon
The increased frequency and intensity of heatwaves in Chicago and their disproportionate impact on marginalized communities.

## Driving Question
How can we understand and address the impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities in Chicago?

## Introduction
On the first day, students will engage with a multimedia presentation showcasing recent heatwaves in Chicago, highlighting their effects on different neighborhoods. This will include news clips, interviews with residents, and data visualizations showing temperature variations across the city. Students will be encouraged to share personal experiences and observations, fostering a connection to the local context and setting the stage for exploring broader climate justice issues.

## Storyline Arc Summary
The unit begins by grounding students in the local impacts of climate change, focusing on heatwaves in Chicago. Students will investigate how these events affect different communities, particularly marginalized ones, and explore the scientific principles behind climate change. Through data analysis and case studies, students will examine the role of human activity in exacerbating climate phenomena. The unit will then shift to exploring solutions, both scientific and social, that can mitigate these impacts. Students will engage in engineering practices to design community-based interventions and learn about social and political actions that can drive change. The unit concludes with students presenting their findings and proposed solutions to a panel of community members and local leaders, emphasizing the importance of civic engagement and advocacy in addressing climate justice.

## Lesson Sets
1. **Understanding Climate Change**: Students will explore the scientific basis of climate change, focusing on greenhouse gases and their effects on global temperatures. They will analyze data from local weather stations and compare it to global trends.

2. **Impact on Communities**: This lesson will delve into how climate change disproportionately affects marginalized communities in Chicago. Students will study case studies and engage with guest speakers from local advocacy groups.

3. **Engineering Solutions**: Students will participate in a design challenge to create solutions that mitigate the effects of heatwaves in their communities. They will apply engineering principles and collaborate in teams to develop prototypes.

4. **Social and Political Action**: This lesson focuses on the role of activism and policy in addressing climate change. Students will research local initiatives and participate in a mock city council meeting to propose policy changes.

5. **Presentation and Reflection**: The final lesson involves students presenting their projects and reflecting on their learning journey. They will receive feedback from peers and community members, fostering a sense of agency and empowerment.

## NGSS Performance Expectations
- HS-ESS3-1: Construct an explanation based on evidence for how the availability of natural resources, occurrence of natural hazards, and climate change have influenced human activity.
- HS-ESS3-4: Evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces impacts of human activities on natural systems.
- HS-ETS1-3: Evaluate a solution to a complex real-world problem based on prioritized criteria and trade-offs that account for a range of constraints, including cost, safety, reliability, and aesthetics, as well as possible social, cultural, and environmental impacts.

## Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts
- How did students connect their personal experiences to the scientific concepts discussed?
- What challenges did students face in designing solutions, and how did they overcome them?
- How effectively did the unit foster a sense of agency and empowerment in students?
- In what ways did students demonstrate criticality in their understanding of climate justice?
