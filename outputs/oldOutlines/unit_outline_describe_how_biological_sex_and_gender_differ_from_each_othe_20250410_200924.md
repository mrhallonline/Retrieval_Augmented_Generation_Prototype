1. Title of the Unit: "Biology and Society: Understanding Sex, Gender, and Athletic Performance"

2. NGSS Anchoring Phenomenon: The differences in athletic performance between individuals of different biological sexes, and how these differences are influenced by genetic mutations and societal perceptions of gender.

3. Driving Question: "How do biological sex, genetic mutations, and societal understanding of gender influence athletic performance?"

4. Summary of the Storyline Arc: 
The unit begins with students observing a local sports event, noting differences in performance between male and female athletes. They then explore the concepts of biological sex and gender, understanding that while they are often used interchangeably, they are distinct. Students will learn about the role of chromosomes in determining biological sex and how genetic mutations can affect the development of sex characteristics. They will then investigate how these biological factors can influence athletic performance. The unit concludes with a discussion on societal perceptions of gender and how these can impact opportunities and expectations in athletics. Throughout the unit, students will be encouraged to consider their local context and the implications of these concepts on their community.

5. Lesson Sets:
   - Lesson 1: Observing and Discussing Local Sports Events
   - Lesson 2: Understanding Biological Sex and Gender
   - Lesson 3: Exploring Chromosomes and Genetic Mutations
   - Lesson 4: Investigating the Impact of Biology on Athletic Performance
   - Lesson 5: Discussing Societal Perceptions of Gender in Athletics

6. Key Investigations:
   - Investigation 1: Observing Differences in Athletic Performance
   - Investigation 2: Modeling Chromosomes and Genetic Mutations
   - Investigation 3: Researching the Biological Factors Influencing Athletic Performance
   - Investigation 4: Exploring Societal Perceptions of Gender in Local Athletics
   - Investigation 5: Reflecting on the Impact of Biology and Society on Athletic Performance

7. NGSS Performance Expectations: 
   - HS-LS1-4: Use a model to illustrate the role of cellular division (mitosis) and differentiation in producing and maintaining complex organisms.
   - HS-LS3-1: Ask questions to clarify relationships about the role of DNA and chromosomes in coding the instructions for characteristic traits passed from parents to offspring.

8. Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts:
   - How did students' understanding of biological sex and gender evolve throughout the unit?
   - How effectively did students apply their understanding of genetics to the context of athletic performance?
   - How did the unit promote inclusive participation and multiple ways of knowing in science?
   - How did students connect the content to their local lives and social issues?
   - How can this unit be improved to better reflect studentsâ€™ cultural identities or community experiences?
