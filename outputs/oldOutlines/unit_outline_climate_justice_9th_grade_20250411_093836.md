**Title of the Unit:**
Climate Justice: Local Actions, Global Impact

**NGSS Anchoring Phenomenon:**
The increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires in California and their disproportionate impact on marginalized communities.

**Driving Question:**
How can we, as a community, address climate justice to mitigate the impacts of climate change on vulnerable populations in Oakland?

**Summary of the Storyline Arc:**
This unit explores the concept of climate justice through the lens of local environmental challenges and their broader global implications. Students will begin by examining the science behind climate change, focusing on the specific impacts seen in California, such as wildfires and air quality issues. They will investigate how these environmental changes disproportionately affect marginalized communities, particularly in urban areas like Oakland. Through a series of investigations, students will analyze data, engage with community members, and explore historical and current social justice movements. The unit will culminate in students designing and proposing actionable solutions to promote climate justice in their community, integrating scientific understanding with social and political action. Throughout the unit, students will reflect on their cultural identities and community experiences, fostering a deeper connection to the material and empowering them to become agents of change.

**List of 3–5 Lesson Sets:**

1. **Understanding Climate Change:**
   Students will explore the scientific principles behind climate change, including the greenhouse effect and carbon cycle. They will analyze local climate data and compare it to global trends, developing an understanding of how climate change manifests in their community.

2. **Impacts on Local Communities:**
   This lesson set focuses on the social and environmental impacts of climate change in Oakland. Students will investigate case studies of local communities affected by wildfires and poor air quality, emphasizing the disproportionate effects on marginalized groups.

3. **Community Voices and Climate Justice:**
   Students will engage with community leaders and activists to understand ongoing efforts to address climate justice. They will participate in discussions and interviews, learning about the intersection of environmental science and social justice.

4. **Designing Solutions:**
   In this set, students will work collaboratively to design solutions that address climate justice issues in their community. They will integrate scientific knowledge with insights from community interactions to propose actionable plans.

5. **Taking Action:**
   The final lesson set focuses on implementing and reflecting on proposed solutions. Students will present their projects to community stakeholders and receive feedback, fostering a sense of empowerment and responsibility.

**List of 3–5 Key Investigations:**

1. **Wildfire Simulation and Analysis:**
   Students will use computational models to simulate wildfire scenarios and analyze the factors contributing to their frequency and intensity. They will assess the impact of these fires on air quality and public health.

2. **Community Air Quality Monitoring:**
   In this investigation, students will collect and analyze air quality data from different neighborhoods in Oakland. They will identify patterns and discuss the implications for community health and climate justice.

3. **Historical Context of Climate Justice:**
   Students will research historical events and policies that have contributed to environmental inequities. They will analyze how these historical contexts shape current climate justice challenges.

4. **Interviews with Local Activists:**
   Students will conduct interviews with local activists and community leaders to gain insights into grassroots efforts for climate justice. They will document these stories and reflect on their implications for scientific and social action.

5. **Solution Design Workshop:**
   In this hands-on investigation, students will brainstorm and prototype solutions to local climate justice issues. They will use design thinking principles to iterate on their ideas and prepare for community presentations.

**NGSS Performance Expectations:**
- HS-ESS3-1: Construct an explanation based on evidence for how the availability of natural resources, occurrence of natural hazards, and climate change have influenced human activity.
- HS-ESS3-4: Evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces impacts of human activities on natural systems.
- HS-ETS1-3: Evaluate a solution to a complex real-world problem based on prioritized criteria and trade-offs that account for a range of constraints, including cost, safety, reliability, and aesthetics, as well as possible social, cultural, and environmental impacts.
