### Unit Title: Climate Justice and Community Resilience

#### NGSS Anchoring Phenomenon:
The disproportionate impact of climate change on marginalized communities in Oakland, California, and the role of community-led initiatives in fostering resilience and adaptation.

#### Driving Question:
How can we, as a community, address climate change impacts and promote climate justice in Oakland?

#### Summary of the Storyline Arc:
This unit begins by exploring the concept of climate justice, emphasizing how climate change disproportionately affects marginalized communities, particularly in urban settings like Oakland. Students will investigate local climate data and historical weather patterns to understand how climate change manifests in their community. They will explore the science behind climate change, focusing on the greenhouse effect and the role of human activities in exacerbating climate impacts. The unit will then shift to examining community resilience, highlighting local initiatives and indigenous knowledge that contribute to sustainable practices. Students will engage with community leaders and activists to learn about ongoing efforts to combat climate change and promote environmental justice. The unit will culminate in a project where students design and propose a community-based initiative to address a specific climate-related issue in Oakland, integrating scientific understanding with cultural and community insights.

#### Lesson Sets:

1. **Understanding Climate Change and Its Impacts:**
   Students will explore the basic science of climate change, focusing on the greenhouse effect and the role of human activities. They will analyze local climate data to identify trends and impacts specific to Oakland, such as heatwaves and air quality issues.

2. **Climate Justice and Equity:**
   This lesson set will delve into the concept of climate justice, examining case studies of marginalized communities disproportionately affected by climate change. Students will discuss the intersection of social justice and environmental science, considering how systemic inequalities exacerbate climate impacts.

3. **Community Resilience and Indigenous Knowledge:**
   Students will learn about local and indigenous practices that contribute to community resilience. They will explore how traditional ecological knowledge can inform sustainable practices and adaptation strategies in the face of climate change.

4. **Engaging with Local Initiatives:**
   Students will interact with local activists and community leaders to learn about ongoing efforts to promote climate justice in Oakland. This lesson set will include guest speakers and field trips to community organizations.

5. **Designing Community-Based Solutions:**
   In the final lesson set, students will work in groups to design a project that addresses a specific climate-related issue in their community. They will present their proposals to a panel of community stakeholders, integrating scientific knowledge with cultural and community insights.

#### Key Investigations:

1. **Local Climate Data Analysis:**
   Students will collect and analyze climate data from Oakland, identifying trends in temperature, precipitation, and air quality. They will use this data to understand the local impacts of global climate change.

2. **Case Study Analysis:**
   Students will examine case studies of communities affected by climate change, focusing on how social and economic factors influence vulnerability and resilience. They will compare these cases to their own community context.

3. **Community Interviews:**
   Students will conduct interviews with local community members, activists, and leaders to gather insights into the challenges and solutions related to climate change in Oakland. This investigation will emphasize the importance of diverse perspectives in understanding climate justice.

4. **Sustainable Practices Exploration:**
   Students will research and present on sustainable practices, both traditional and modern, that contribute to community resilience. They will explore how these practices can be applied or adapted to their local context.

5. **Project Design and Presentation:**
   Students will apply their learning to design a community-based project addressing a climate-related issue. They will present their projects to a panel of community stakeholders, receiving feedback and refining their proposals.

#### NGSS Performance Expectations:
- HS-ESS3-1: Construct an explanation based on evidence for how the availability of natural resources, occurrence of natural hazards, and climate change have influenced human activity.
- HS-ESS3-4: Evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces impacts of human activities on natural systems.
- HS-ESS3-5: Analyze geoscience data and the results from global climate models to make an evidence-based forecast of the current rate of global or regional climate change and associated future impacts to Earth systems.

#### Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts:
1. How did the students engage with the concept of climate justice, and what connections did they make to their own community?
2. In what ways did students demonstrate an understanding of the scientific principles underlying climate change?
3. How effectively did students incorporate community and cultural insights into their project designs?
4. What challenges did students encounter in designing community-based solutions, and how did they address them?
5. How can the unit be adapted or expanded to further integrate culturally responsive pedagogy and local context?
