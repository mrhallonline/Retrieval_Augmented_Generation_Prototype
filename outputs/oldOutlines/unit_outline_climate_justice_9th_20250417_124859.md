## Unit Title: Climate Justice and Local Action

### Anchoring Phenomenon
The increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires in California, particularly in local communities, and their disproportionate impact on marginalized communities.

### Driving Question
How can we use science and engineering to promote climate justice and protect vulnerable communities from the impacts of climate change?

### Introduction
On the first day, students will be introduced to the phenomenon of wildfires in California through a multimedia presentation that includes news clips, personal stories, and scientific data. This will be followed by a discussion on how these fires affect different communities, especially those that are historically marginalized. Students will be encouraged to share their own experiences or stories they have heard from family and friends.

### Storyline Arc Summary
The unit begins with an exploration of the science behind climate change and its specific manifestations in California, such as wildfires. Students will then investigate the social and environmental impacts of these events, focusing on issues of equity and justice. Through a series of lessons, students will engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design to propose solutions that mitigate the effects of wildfires on vulnerable communities. The unit concludes with students presenting their solutions and reflecting on their role in advocating for climate justice.

### Lesson Sets
1. **Understanding Climate Change**: Introduction to climate science, focusing on greenhouse gases and their role in global warming.
2. **Wildfires and Their Impact**: Examination of the causes and effects of wildfires in California, with a focus on local case studies.
3. **Equity and Justice in Climate Change**: Exploration of how climate change disproportionately affects marginalized communities.
4. **Engineering Solutions for Wildfire Mitigation**: Students design and test solutions to reduce the impact of wildfires on vulnerable communities.
5. **Advocacy and Action**: Students develop and present action plans for promoting climate justice in their communities.

### Week-by-Week Plan

#### Week 1: Understanding Climate Change
- **Objectives**: Understand the basic science of climate change and its global and local impacts.
- **Key Activities**: Interactive lecture, data analysis of temperature trends, group discussions.
- **Assessments**: Formative assessment through quizzes and participation in discussions.
- **Cultivating Genius**: Focus on building identity by connecting scientific concepts to students' own experiences and communities.

#### Week 2: Wildfires and Their Impact
- **Objectives**: Analyze the causes and effects of wildfires, particularly in California.
- **Key Activities**: Case study analysis, guest speaker from a local fire department, field trip to a local affected area (if possible).
- **Assessments**: Reflection essays on the impact of wildfires.
- **Cultivating Genius**: Develop criticality by examining how wildfires affect different communities and discussing issues of equity.

#### Week 3: Equity and Justice in Climate Change
- **Objectives**: Explore the intersection of climate change and social justice.
- **Key Activities**: Role-playing activities, debates, and research projects on climate justice.
- **Assessments**: Group presentations on findings related to climate justice.
- **Cultivating Genius**: Enhance intellect by researching and presenting on historical and current issues of climate justice.

#### Week 4: Engineering Solutions for Wildfire Mitigation
- **Objectives**: Design and test engineering solutions to mitigate wildfire impacts.
- **Key Activities**: Engineering design challenges, prototype development, and testing.
- **Assessments**: Evaluation of prototypes and peer feedback sessions.
- **Cultivating Genius**: Build skills by engaging in hands-on engineering practices and problem-solving.

#### Week 5: Advocacy and Action
- **Objectives**: Develop and present action plans for climate justice advocacy.
- **Key Activities**: Action plan development, presentations to local stakeholders, community engagement projects.
- **Assessments**: Summative assessment through action plan presentations and community feedback.
- **Cultivating Genius**: Foster criticality and identity by empowering students to advocate for change in their communities.

### NGSS Performance Expectations
- HS-ESS3-1: Construct an explanation based on evidence for how the availability of natural resources, occurrence of natural hazards, and climate change have influenced human activity.
- HS-ESS3-4: Evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces impacts of human activities on natural systems.
- HS-ETS1-2: Design a solution to a complex real-world problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable problems that can be solved through engineering.

### Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts
- How did students' understanding of climate justice evolve throughout the unit?
- In what ways did students demonstrate critical thinking and problem-solving skills?
- How effectively did the unit integrate culturally responsive teaching practices?
