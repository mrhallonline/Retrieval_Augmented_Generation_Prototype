  "summary": "On the first day, students will explore their local neighborhood through a virtual or physical walk, documenting evidence of urban heat islands and air pollution. They will collect data using temperature sensors and air quality monitors, setting the stage for understanding how these environmental issues affect their community. This hands-on experience will connect students to the phenomenon by highlighting real-world problems they encounter daily. The unit begins with students identifying climate justice issues in their community, focusing on urban heat islands and air pollution. They will investigate the science behind these phenomena, learning about the greenhouse effect, energy transfer, and the role of human activities. Through data collection and analysis, students will assess the impact of these issues on health and the environment. They will explore engineering solutions, such as green roofs and urban greening, and evaluate their feasibility in their neighborhoods. The unit culminates in a community presentation where students propose actionable solutions to local stakeholders, empowering them to advocate for change.",
