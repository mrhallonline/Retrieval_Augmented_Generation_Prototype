1. Title of the Unit: "Climate Justice: Understanding and Addressing Climate Change in Our Community"

2. NGSS Anchoring Phenomenon: The increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires in California and its impact on the local community in Oakland.

3. Driving Question: "How does climate change impact our community in Oakland, and what actions can we take to promote climate justice?"

4. Summary of the Storyline Arc: The unit begins by exploring the concept of climate change and its global impacts, using the increasing frequency of wildfires in California as an anchoring phenomenon. Students then investigate the causes and effects of climate change, focusing on the role of human activities and the impact on their local community in Oakland. They examine case studies of climate justice, understanding how climate change disproportionately affects marginalized communities. Students then explore potential solutions and mitigation strategies, including renewable energy sources and policy changes. The unit culminates in a project where students develop an action plan to promote climate justice in their community.

5. Lesson Sets:
   - Lesson Set 1: Introduction to Climate Change - Students learn the basics of climate change, including greenhouse gases and their impact on global temperatures.
   - Lesson Set 2: Climate Change and Our Community - Students investigate how climate change is impacting their local community, focusing on the increasing frequency of wildfires.
   - Lesson Set 3: Climate Justice - Students explore the concept of climate justice, understanding how climate change disproportionately affects marginalized communities.
   - Lesson Set 4: Solutions and Mitigation Strategies - Students learn about potential solutions to climate change, including renewable energy sources and policy changes.
   - Lesson Set 5: Action Plan for Climate Justice - Students develop an action plan to promote climate justice in their community.

6. Key Investigations:
   - Investigation 1: Causes of Climate Change - Students investigate the main causes of climate change, including the role of human activities.
   - Investigation 2: Impact of Climate Change on Our Community - Students explore how climate change is impacting their local community, focusing on the increasing frequency of wildfires.
   - Investigation 3: Climate Justice Case Studies - Students examine case studies of climate justice, understanding how climate change disproportionately affects marginalized communities.
   - Investigation 4: Solutions to Climate Change - Students research potential solutions to climate change, including renewable energy sources and policy changes.
