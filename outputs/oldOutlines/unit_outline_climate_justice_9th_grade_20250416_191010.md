### Unit Outline: Climate Justice in Oakland

#### 1. Title of the Unit
Climate Justice: Understanding and Acting on Local and Global Impacts

#### 2. NGSS Anchoring Phenomenon
The disproportionate impact of climate change on marginalized communities in Oakland and the broader Bay Area.

#### 3. Driving Question
How can we understand and address the impacts of climate change on our community and contribute to climate justice?

#### 4. Summary of the Storyline Arc
This unit explores the concept of climate justice, focusing on how climate change disproportionately affects marginalized communities, particularly in urban areas like Oakland. Students will begin by examining local climate data and community experiences to identify specific impacts such as air quality issues, heat islands, and flooding. They will learn about the science behind these phenomena, including the role of greenhouse gases and urban planning. The unit will incorporate culturally responsive pedagogy by connecting scientific concepts to students' lived experiences and community histories. Students will engage in hands-on investigations and use scientific practices to analyze data, model climate impacts, and propose solutions. The unit will culminate in a community action project where students design and present strategies to mitigate climate impacts in their neighborhoods, fostering a sense of agency and empowerment.

#### 5. List of Lesson Sets

**Lesson Set 1: Introduction to Climate Justice**
- Students will explore the concept of climate justice and its relevance to their lives. They will discuss how climate change impacts different communities unequally and examine case studies from Oakland.

**Lesson Set 2: Understanding Climate Science**
- This set will focus on the science of climate change, including greenhouse gases, the greenhouse effect, and the role of human activities. Students will analyze local climate data and identify patterns and trends.

**Lesson Set 3: Local Impacts and Community Stories**
- Students will investigate specific climate impacts in Oakland, such as air quality and urban heat islands. They will conduct interviews and gather stories from community members to understand personal and collective experiences.

**Lesson Set 4: Scientific Practices and Solutions**
- Students will engage in scientific practices, including data analysis and modeling, to explore potential solutions to local climate issues. They will learn about sustainable practices and technologies that can mitigate climate impacts.

**Lesson Set 5: Community Action and Advocacy**
- The final set will focus on empowering students to take action. They will design and implement a community project aimed at addressing a local climate issue, using their scientific knowledge and community insights.

#### 6. List of Key Investigations

**Investigation 1: Air Quality Monitoring**
- Students will use sensors and data collection tools to measure air quality in different parts of Oakland. They will analyze the data to identify patterns and potential sources of pollution.

**Investigation 2: Urban Heat Island Effect**
- Through field studies and temperature mapping, students will investigate the urban heat island effect in Oakland. They will explore how different surfaces and vegetation impact local temperatures.

**Investigation 3: Flood Risk Assessment**
- Students will use geographic information systems (GIS) to assess flood risks in their neighborhoods. They will model how increased rainfall and sea-level rise could affect their community.

**Investigation 4: Carbon Footprint Analysis**
- Students will calculate their personal and school carbon footprints. They will explore ways to reduce emissions through lifestyle changes and community initiatives.

**Investigation 5: Community Interviews and Storytelling**
- Students will conduct interviews with community members to gather stories about climate impacts and resilience. They will use these narratives to inform their understanding and advocacy efforts.

#### 7. NGSS Performance Expectations
- HS-ESS3-1: Construct an explanation based on evidence for how the availability of natural resources, occurrence of natural hazards, and changes in climate have influenced human activity.
- HS-ESS3-4: Evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces impacts of human activities on natural systems.
- HS-ESS3-5: Analyze geoscience data and the results from global climate models to make an evidence-based forecast of the current rate of global or regional climate change and associated future impacts to Earth systems.

#### 8. Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts
- How did students connect their personal and community experiences to the scientific concepts explored in this unit?
- In what ways did the unit foster student agency and empower them to take action on climate issues?
- How effectively did the unit incorporate culturally responsive teaching practices?
- What challenges did students encounter in understanding the science of climate change, and how were these addressed?
- How can the community action projects be expanded or sustained beyond the unit?
