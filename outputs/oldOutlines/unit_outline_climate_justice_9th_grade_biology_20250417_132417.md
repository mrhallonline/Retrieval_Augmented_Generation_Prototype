## Unit Title: Climate Justice in Chicago: Understanding and Acting for Our Future

### Anchoring Phenomenon
The disproportionate impact of urban heat islands in Chicago neighborhoods and their relation to climate justice and public health.

### Driving Question
How can we address climate justice issues in our community to create a more equitable and sustainable future?

### Introduction
On the first day, students will engage with a local news segment or documentary that highlights the urban heat island effect in Chicago, particularly focusing on neighborhoods that are predominantly inhabited by marginalized communities. This will be followed by a discussion on how these environmental issues intersect with social justice, setting the stage for the unit's exploration of climate justice.

### Storyline Arc Summary
The unit begins by introducing students to the concept of climate justice through the lens of local issues, specifically the urban heat island effect in Chicago. Students will explore the science behind climate change and its unequal impacts on different communities. They will engage in data collection and analysis, examining local temperature variations and their effects on public health. Throughout the unit, students will connect these scientific concepts to social justice issues, considering how systemic inequalities exacerbate environmental problems. By the end of the unit, students will propose actionable solutions to mitigate the urban heat island effect in their neighborhoods, incorporating both scientific understanding and social advocacy.

### Lesson Sets
1. **Introduction to Climate Justice**: Students explore the concept of climate justice, focusing on local examples such as the urban heat island effect. They discuss how climate change impacts different communities unequally.
   
2. **Understanding Urban Heat Islands**: This lesson delves into the science behind urban heat islands, including data collection and analysis of temperature differences across Chicago neighborhoods.
   
3. **Health Impacts and Social Inequality**: Students investigate the public health implications of urban heat islands and how they disproportionately affect marginalized groups. They explore case studies and engage in discussions on systemic inequality.
   
4. **Community Voices and Solutions**: Students learn about local initiatives and community voices advocating for climate justice. They research and present on different strategies being employed to combat climate issues locally.
   
5. **Action Planning and Advocacy**: In the final lesson, students develop their own action plans to address climate justice in their community, integrating scientific research with social advocacy.

### Week-by-Week Plan
**Week 1**: Introduction to climate justice and urban heat islands. Students will engage with local media and begin initial discussions on the intersection of climate and social justice.

**Week 2**: Focus on the science of urban heat islands. Students will conduct experiments and analyze data to understand temperature variations in Chicago.

**Week 3**: Examine the health impacts of climate change on different communities. Students will participate in case study analyses and discussions on inequality.

**Week 4**: Explore local climate justice initiatives. Students will research and present on community efforts to combat climate issues.

**Week 5**: Develop and present action plans. Students will create proposals for addressing climate justice in their communities, combining scientific understanding with advocacy.

### Notes on Integrating Cultivating Genius
- **Identity**: Encourage students to explore their own identities and how they relate to climate justice issues. Discussions will allow students to share personal experiences and reflections.
- **Skill**: Develop critical thinking and data analysis skills through hands-on investigations and research projects.
- **Intellect**: Foster intellectual curiosity by connecting scientific concepts to real-world social issues, encouraging students to think deeply about the implications of climate justice.
- **Criticality**: Empower students to critique systemic inequalities and develop solutions that promote social transformation and equity.

### NGSS Performance Expectations
- HS-ESS3-1: Construct an explanation based on evidence for how the availability of natural resources, occurrence of natural hazards, and changes in climate have influenced human activity.
- HS-ESS3-4: Evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces impacts of human activities on natural systems.
- HS-ETS1-3: Evaluate a solution to a complex real-world problem based on prioritized criteria and trade-offs that account for a range of constraints, including cost, safety, reliability, and aesthetics, as well as possible social, cultural, and environmental impacts.

### Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts
- How did students connect their personal experiences to the concept of climate justice?
- In what ways did students demonstrate critical thinking and problem-solving skills?
- How effectively did the unit integrate scientific understanding with social advocacy?
- What changes could be made to further support culturally responsive teaching in this unit?
