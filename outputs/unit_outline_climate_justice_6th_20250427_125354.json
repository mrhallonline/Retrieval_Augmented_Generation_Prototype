  "summary": "On the first day, students will engage with a multimedia presentation showcasing the effects of climate change on the Bay Area, including rising sea levels and wildfires. This will include personal stories from community members affected by these changes, connecting students to the phenomenon through their own community's experiences. The unit begins by introducing students to the concept of climate justice, emphasizing how climate change disproportionately affects marginalized communities. Students will explore the science behind climate change, focusing on local impacts in the Bay Area. They will investigate the role of ecosystems in mitigating climate effects and analyze data on local climate patterns. Throughout the unit, students will engage in problem-solving activities to design solutions that address climate impacts in their community. The unit concludes with students presenting their findings and proposed solutions to a panel of community stakeholders, fostering a sense of agency and empowerment.",
