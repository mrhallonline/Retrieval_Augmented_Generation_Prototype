## Unit Title: Climate Justice: Understanding and Acting Locally

### Anchoring Phenomenon
The increased frequency and intensity of heatwaves in Chicago and their disproportionate impact on Black and Latinx communities.

### Driving Question
How can we use our understanding of climate science to advocate for climate justice in our communities?

### Introduction
On the first day, students will be introduced to the concept of climate justice through a local news report highlighting recent heatwaves in Chicago and their impact on neighborhoods. This will be followed by a class discussion on personal experiences with extreme weather and its effects on their families and communities. Students will be encouraged to share stories and observations, setting the stage for a unit focused on understanding and addressing climate impacts locally.

### Storyline Arc Summary
The unit begins by exploring the science behind climate change, focusing on the greenhouse effect and its role in global warming. Students will investigate how climate change manifests in local weather patterns, specifically heatwaves, and analyze data to understand its impact on different communities in Chicago. Throughout the unit, students will engage in science and engineering practices, such as data collection and analysis, to explore the intersection of climate science and social justice. They will learn about historical and systemic factors contributing to environmental inequities and develop strategies for advocacy and community action. The unit culminates in a student-led project where they propose solutions to mitigate the effects of heatwaves in their neighborhoods, integrating scientific understanding with community needs.

### Lesson Sets
1. **Introduction to Climate Science**: Students will explore the basic principles of climate science, focusing on the greenhouse effect and its role in global warming. They will engage in hands-on activities to model these concepts and discuss their implications for local weather patterns.

2. **Local Climate Impacts**: This lesson focuses on analyzing local climate data, particularly heatwave patterns in Chicago. Students will use data analysis tools to identify trends and discuss the social and economic impacts on their communities.

3. **Environmental Justice and Equity**: Students will learn about environmental justice and the historical context of climate inequities. They will explore case studies of local communities disproportionately affected by climate change and discuss systemic factors contributing to these disparities.

4. **Community Voices and Advocacy**: This lesson emphasizes the importance of community voices in climate advocacy. Students will research local organizations and initiatives addressing climate justice and explore ways to engage with these efforts.

5. **Designing Solutions for Climate Action**: In the final lesson, students will work in groups to design and present solutions for mitigating the effects of heatwaves in their communities. They will integrate scientific understanding with community needs and propose actionable steps for local advocacy.
