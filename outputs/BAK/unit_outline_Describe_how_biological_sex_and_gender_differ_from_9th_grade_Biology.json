  "raw_outline": "1. Title of the Unit: \"Biology and Society: Understanding Sex, Gender, and Genetic Variation\"\n\n2. NGSS Anchoring Phenomenon: The diverse expression of biological sex characteristics and the impact of genetic mutations on these characteristics.\n\n3. Driving Question: How do biological sex and gender differ from each other, and how can mutations in various genes affect the development of internal and external sex characteristics and athletic performance?\n\n4. Summary of the Storyline Arc: This unit begins with an exploration of the concepts of biological sex and gender, emphasizing their differences and the societal implications of these terms. Students will then delve into the science of genetics, learning about the role of chromosomes in determining biological sex. They will explore how mutations can lead to variations in sex characteristics, and how these variations can impact an individual's life, including their athletic performance. The unit will also touch on the cultural and societal aspects of these topics, encouraging students to consider these issues from various perspectives. The unit will conclude with a discussion on the importance of inclusivity and respect for diversity in science and society.\n\n5. Lesson Sets:\n   - Lesson 1: Introduction to Biological Sex and Gender: This lesson will introduce students to the concepts of biological sex and gender, discussing their differences and societal implications.\n   - Lesson 2: Genetics and Biological Sex: This lesson will delve into the role of chromosomes in determining biological sex and how genetic mutations can lead to variations in sex characteristics.\n   - Lesson 3: Impact of Genetic Variations: This lesson will explore how genetic variations can impact an individual's life, including their athletic performance.\n   - Lesson 4: Cultural and Societal Perspectives: This lesson will encourage students to consider the cultural and societal aspects of these topics, promoting a broader understanding of these issues.\n   - Lesson 5: Inclusivity and Respect for Diversity: This lesson will conclude the unit with a discussion on the importance of inclusivity and respect for diversity in science and society.\n\n6. Key Investigations:\n   - Investigation 1: Exploring the Genetics of Biological Sex: Students will investigate the role of chromosomes in determining biological sex.\n   - Investigation 2: Understanding Genetic Mutations: Students will explore how genetic mutations can lead to variations in sex characteristics.\n   - Investigation 3: Analyzing the Impact of Genetic Variations: Students will analyze the impact of genetic variations on an individual's life, including their athletic performance.\n   - Investigation 4: Exploring Cultural and Societal Perspectives: Students will investigate the cultural and societal aspects of these topics.\n   - Investigation 5: Promoting Inclusivity and Respect for Diversity: Students will discuss the importance of inclusivity and respect for diversity in science and society.\n\n7. NGSS Performance Expectations: HS-LS1-4, HS-LS3-1, HS-LS3-2\n\n8. Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts:\n   - How did the students respond to the discussions about biological sex and gender? Were there any misconceptions that needed to be addressed?\n   - How well did the students understand the role of chromosomes in determining biological sex and the impact of genetic mutations?\n   - Did the students show an understanding of the cultural and societal aspects of these topics?\n   - How effectively did the students discuss the importance of inclusivity and respect for diversity in science and society?\n   - How can I improve this unit to better meet the needs of my students and promote a more inclusive learning environment?",
