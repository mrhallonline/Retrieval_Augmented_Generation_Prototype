Unit Title: 
"Climate Justice in Our Backyard: Understanding and Addressing Environmental Inequities in Oakland"

NGSS Anchoring Phenomenon: 
Why does Oakland, a city with a significant Black and Brown population, experience more severe effects of climate change compared to other cities?

Driving Question: 
How can we leverage scientific understanding and community knowledge to combat environmental injustice and promote climate resilience in Oakland?

Unit Summary: 
In this unit, students will delve into the science behind climate change and its disproportionate impacts on communities of color, particularly in their hometown of Oakland. They will explore real-life case studies from their local area, examining how systemic racism and policy decisions have led to disparities in pollution exposure, heat stress, and access to green spaces. Students will learn how to analyze environmental data, investigate local solutions, and advocate for climate justice. The unit will culminate with students developing action plans or advocacy campaigns to promote climate justice in their own communities.

Lesson Sets: 

1. Climate Science and Environmental Justice: Introduction to climate change and its impacts, with a focus on environmental justice principles and how they apply to Oakland.

2. Community Impacts and Local Data: Analysis of local environmental data, including air and water quality, and exploration of how these issues affect students' communities.

3. Investigating Solutions: Evaluation of potential solutions, such as green infrastructure, and brainstorming of new ideas to address local environmental problems.

4. Taking Action: Development of student-led action plans or advocacy campaigns to promote climate justice in Oakland.

Key Investigations: 

1. Analysis of Local Environmental Data: Students will analyze local environmental data to understand the specific climate-related challenges facing their communities.

2. Case Study Exploration: Students will explore case studies of environmental injustice in Oakland, understanding the historical and systemic factors that have led to these issues.

3. Solution Evaluation and Brainstorming: Students will evaluate potential solutions to local environmental problems and brainstorm new ideas.

4. Action Plan Development: Students will develop action plans or advocacy campaigns to promote climate justice in their communities.
