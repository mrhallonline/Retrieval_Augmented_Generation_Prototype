  "summary": "On the first day, students will explore the phenomenon of wildfires in the Bay Area through a multimedia presentation that includes news clips, interviews with local residents, and scientific data. This will help students connect personally to the issue by seeing how it affects their own communities and the ecosystems they interact with. Students will be encouraged to share their own experiences and observations related to climate change and its impacts on their neighborhoods. The unit begins by introducing students to the concept of climate justice, focusing on how environmental changes disproportionately affect marginalized communities. Students will investigate the local ecosystems of the Bay Area, examining how climate change impacts these environments and the people living there. Through hands-on activities and data analysis, students will explore the science behind climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions and their effects on weather patterns. The unit will also include discussions on social and political actions that can be taken to mitigate these impacts, encouraging students to think critically about their roles in advocating for change. By the end of the unit, students will develop a community action plan to address climate justice issues in their area, presenting their findings and solutions to local stakeholders.",
