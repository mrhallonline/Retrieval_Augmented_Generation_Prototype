  "summary": "On the first day, students will be introduced to the concept of climate justice through a localized lens. They will explore recent instances of flooding in Oakland and its effects on local ecosystems and communities. Students will engage with multimedia resources, including news clips and interviews with local residents, to understand the real-world implications of climate change in their area. This will set the stage for a deeper investigation into the science and social aspects of climate justice. The unit begins with students exploring the immediate effects of climate change on their local environment, focusing on flooding in the Bay Area. As they delve deeper, they will learn about the scientific principles behind climate change, including the greenhouse effect and carbon cycles. Students will engage in hands-on activities and experiments to understand these concepts better. The unit will then shift to examining the social justice aspects, where students will learn about how climate change disproportionately affects marginalized communities, particularly Black and Latinx populations in Oakland. They will explore case studies and engage in discussions to develop a critical understanding of climate justice. The unit will culminate in a project where students propose actionable solutions to mitigate climate change impacts in their community, integrating scientific knowledge and social justice principles.",
