  "summary": "On the first day, students will be introduced to the concept of climate justice through a local news report highlighting recent heatwaves in Chicago and their impact on neighborhoods. This will be followed by a class discussion on personal experiences with extreme weather and its effects on their families and communities. Students will be encouraged to share stories and observations, setting the stage for a unit focused on understanding and addressing climate impacts locally. The unit begins by exploring the science behind climate change, focusing on the greenhouse effect and its role in global warming. Students will investigate how climate change manifests in local weather patterns, specifically heatwaves, and analyze data to understand its impact on different communities in Chicago. Throughout the unit, students will engage in science and engineering practices, such as data collection and analysis, to explore the intersection of climate science and social justice. They will learn about historical and systemic factors contributing to environmental inequities and develop strategies for advocacy and community action. The unit culminates in a student-led project where they propose solutions to mitigate the effects of heatwaves in their neighborhoods, integrating scientific understanding with community needs.",
