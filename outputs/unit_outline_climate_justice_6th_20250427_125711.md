## Unit Title: Climate Justice in the Bay Area

### Anchoring Phenomenon
The increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires in the Bay Area and their disproportionate impact on Black and Latinx communities in Oakland.

### Driving Question
How can we address climate justice in our local ecosystems to protect vulnerable communities?

### Introduction
On the first day, students will explore the phenomenon of wildfires in the Bay Area through a multimedia presentation that includes news clips, interviews with local residents, and scientific data. This will help students connect personally to the issue by seeing how it affects their own communities and the ecosystems they interact with. Students will be encouraged to share their own experiences and observations related to climate change and its impacts on their neighborhoods.

### Storyline Arc Summary
The unit begins by introducing students to the concept of climate justice, focusing on how environmental changes disproportionately affect marginalized communities. Students will investigate the local ecosystems of the Bay Area, examining how climate change impacts these environments and the people living there. Through hands-on activities and data analysis, students will explore the science behind climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions and their effects on weather patterns. The unit will also include discussions on social and political actions that can be taken to mitigate these impacts, encouraging students to think critically about their roles in advocating for change. By the end of the unit, students will develop a community action plan to address climate justice issues in their area, presenting their findings and solutions to local stakeholders.

### Lesson Sets

#### Lesson 1: Understanding Local Ecosystems
Students will explore the ecosystems of the Bay Area, identifying key species and their roles within these environments. They will use maps and field guides to document the biodiversity in their neighborhoods. The goal is to understand how these ecosystems function and how they are affected by climate change. Students will discuss common misconceptions, such as the idea that all ecosystems are equally affected by climate change, and will be prompted to share their prior knowledge about local wildlife and plant life.

#### Lesson 2: The Science of Climate Change
In this lesson, students will delve into the science behind climate change, focusing on greenhouse gases and their effects on the Earth's climate. They will conduct experiments to measure carbon dioxide levels and analyze data on temperature changes over time. Students will use models to visualize how these changes impact local weather patterns and ecosystems. Misconceptions such as "climate change is just about warming" will be addressed, and students will be asked to reflect on how they have observed climate changes in their own lives.

#### Lesson 3: Climate Justice and Community Impact
Students will examine case studies of how climate change disproportionately affects marginalized communities, particularly in the Bay Area. They will engage in discussions about environmental justice and explore the social and political factors that contribute to these disparities. Students will be encouraged to think critically about their own community's vulnerabilities and strengths. Questions will be posed to help students consider how historical and systemic issues contribute to current climate justice challenges.

#### Lesson 4: Engineering Solutions for Climate Resilience
This lesson focuses on engineering practices to develop solutions for climate resilience. Students will work in groups to design and prototype solutions that could help their communities adapt to climate change, such as green roofs or community gardens. They will use engineering design principles and receive feedback from peers and local experts. Common misconceptions about the feasibility of certain solutions will be discussed, and students will be encouraged to think creatively about realistic and sustainable options.

#### Lesson 5: Taking Action and Advocacy
In the final lesson, students will create a community action plan to address climate justice issues they have identified. They will present their plans to local stakeholders, including community leaders and environmental organizations. The goal is to empower students to take action and advocate for change in their communities. Students will reflect on their learning journey, discussing how their understanding of climate justice has evolved and what steps they can take to continue advocating for their communities.

### Key Investigations
1. **Wildfire Impact Analysis**: Students will analyze data on recent wildfires in the Bay Area, examining their causes and effects on local ecosystems and communities.
2. **Carbon Footprint Experiment**: Students will conduct experiments to measure carbon dioxide emissions from various sources and discuss their implications for climate change.
3. **Biodiversity Survey**: Students will conduct a survey of local biodiversity, documenting species and their roles in the ecosystem, and assessing how climate change might affect them.
4. **Community Vulnerability Assessment**: Students will assess the vulnerabilities of their communities to climate change, considering factors such as infrastructure, resources, and social networks.
5. **Solution Design Challenge**: Students will design and prototype solutions to enhance community resilience to climate change, using engineering principles and feedback from peers and experts.

### Integration of Cultivating Genius
- **Identity**: Students will explore their own cultural identities and how these intersect with environmental issues, fostering a sense of belonging and relevance.
- **Skill**: The unit emphasizes critical thinking, data analysis, and problem-solving skills, empowering students to engage with complex scientific and social issues.
- **Intellect**: Students will build a deep understanding of climate science and justice, connecting theoretical knowledge with real-world applications.
- **Criticality**: The unit encourages students to critically examine power structures and advocate for social justice, empowering them to challenge inequities in their communities.

### NGSS Performance Expectations
- MS-ESS3-3: Apply scientific principles to design a method for monitoring and minimizing human impact on the environment.
- MS-ESS3-4: Construct an argument supported by evidence for how increases in human population and per-capita consumption of natural resources impact Earth's systems.
- MS-ETS1-1: Define the criteria and constraints of a design problem with sufficient precision to ensure a successful solution.

### Student Learning Objectives
- Analyze the impact of climate change on local ecosystems and communities.
- Develop and test solutions to enhance community resilience to climate change.
- Advocate for climate justice through informed discussions and community engagement.

### Common Student Misconceptions
- Climate change only causes warming, not other weather changes.
- All communities are equally affected by climate change.
- Individual actions cannot make a significant impact on climate issues.

### Specific Questions to Surface Prior Knowledge
- What changes have you noticed in the weather or environment in your neighborhood?
- How do you think climate change affects the plants and animals around you?
- What actions have you or your family taken to address environmental issues?

### Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts
- How did students' understanding of climate justice evolve throughout the unit?
- What strategies were most effective in engaging students with the local context?
- How can I continue to support students in taking action on climate issues beyond this unit?
