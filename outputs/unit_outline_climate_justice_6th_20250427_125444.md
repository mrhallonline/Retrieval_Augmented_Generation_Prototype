## Unit Outline: Climate Justice

### 1. Title of the Unit
**Climate Justice: Understanding and Acting Locally**

### 2. Anchoring Phenomenon
**Localized Flooding in Oakland:** Students will explore the increasing frequency and intensity of localized flooding in Oakland, particularly in areas with high Black and Latinx populations, and its impact on local ecosystems and communities.

### 3. Driving Question
**How can we use our understanding of climate science to promote climate justice in our community?**

### 4. Introduction
On the first day, students will be introduced to the concept of climate justice through a community-focused lens. They will watch a short documentary featuring local activists and community members discussing the impact of climate change on Oakland. This will be followed by a classroom discussion on how climate change affects different communities differently, setting the stage for exploring the scientific and social aspects of climate justice.

### 5. Storyline Arc Summary
The unit begins by grounding students in the local context of climate change impacts, specifically focusing on flooding in Oakland. Students will investigate the scientific principles behind climate change, such as the greenhouse effect and its role in altering weather patterns. They will then explore how these changes disproportionately affect marginalized communities. Throughout the unit, students will engage in data analysis and engineering practices to understand the local ecosystem's response to climate change. The unit will culminate in a community project where students propose solutions to mitigate the impact of climate change on their neighborhoods. By integrating scientific inquiry with social justice, students will develop a comprehensive understanding of climate justice and their role in advocating for equitable solutions.

### 6. Lesson Sets

#### Lesson 1: **Understanding Climate Change**
- **Description:** Students will explore the basic science of climate change, focusing on the greenhouse effect and its impact on global and local climates. They will conduct experiments to visualize how greenhouse gases trap heat.
- **Student Goals:** Understand the scientific basis of climate change and its local manifestations.
- **Equity and Participation:** Use diverse groupings to ensure all voices are heard and provide scaffolding for students who need additional support.
- **Common Misconceptions:** Climate change is not real or is not caused by human activities.
- **Questions to Surface Prior Knowledge:** What do you know about climate change? How do you think it affects our weather?

#### Lesson 2: **Local Impacts of Climate Change**
- **Description:** Students will analyze local data on flooding in Oakland, identifying patterns and predicting future impacts. They will use maps and GIS tools to visualize data.
- **Student Goals:** Connect climate science to local phenomena and understand the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities.
- **Equity and Participation:** Incorporate stories and data from students' communities to make learning relevant and engaging.
- **Common Misconceptions:** Climate change impacts are the same everywhere.
- **Questions to Surface Prior Knowledge:** How has the weather changed in your neighborhood over the years?

#### Lesson 3: **Ecosystem Responses**
- **Description:** Investigate how local ecosystems, such as the Bay Area wetlands, respond to climate change. Students will conduct field studies and analyze ecosystem health indicators.
- **Student Goals:** Understand ecosystem dynamics and the role of biodiversity in resilience.
- **Equity and Participation:** Provide opportunities for students to share their observations and connect them to cultural knowledge.
- **Common Misconceptions:** Ecosystems are static and do not change.
- **Questions to Surface Prior Knowledge:** What plants and animals do you notice in your community? How do they change with the seasons?

#### Lesson 4: **Engineering Solutions for Climate Justice**
- **Description:** Students will engage in a design challenge to create solutions that mitigate flooding in their community. They will use engineering practices to prototype and test their designs.
- **Student Goals:** Apply scientific and engineering practices to real-world problems.
- **Equity and Participation:** Encourage collaboration and ensure all students have access to materials and resources.
- **Common Misconceptions:** Engineering solutions are too complex for students to understand.
- **Questions to Surface Prior Knowledge:** What solutions have you seen or heard about for dealing with flooding?

#### Lesson 5: **Community Action and Advocacy**
- **Description:** Students will develop action plans to advocate for climate justice in their community. They will present their findings and proposals to local stakeholders.
- **Student Goals:** Empower students to take action and advocate for their communities.
- **Equity and Participation:** Provide platforms for student voices and ensure diverse perspectives are included.
- **Common Misconceptions:** Individual actions do not make a difference.
- **Questions to Surface Prior Knowledge:** How can you make a difference in your community regarding climate change?

### 7. Key Investigations
- **Greenhouse Effect Experiment:** Students will simulate the greenhouse effect using simple materials to observe how gases trap heat.
- **Local Flooding Data Analysis:** Analyze historical flooding data in Oakland to identify trends and predict future events.
- **Ecosystem Health Assessment:** Conduct field studies in local ecosystems to measure indicators of health and resilience.
- **Design Challenge:** Prototype and test engineering solutions to mitigate flooding impacts.
- **Community Engagement:** Develop and present action plans to local stakeholders to advocate for climate justice.

### 8. Notes on Cultivating Genius Integration
- **Identity:** Students explore their cultural connections to the local environment and how climate change affects their communities.
- **Skill:** Develop scientific inquiry and engineering design skills through hands-on investigations and problem-solving.
- **Intellect:** Build a deep understanding of climate science and its social implications.
- **Criticality:** Critically analyze the intersection of climate change and social justice, empowering students to advocate for change.

### 9. NGSS Performance Expectations
- **MS-ESS3-3:** Apply scientific principles to design a method for monitoring and minimizing a human impact on the environment.
- **MS-ESS3-4:** Construct an argument supported by evidence for how increases in human population and per-capita consumption of natural resources impact Earth's systems.

### 10. Student Learning Objectives
- Understand the scientific principles of climate change and its local impacts.
- Analyze data to identify patterns and predict future climate-related events.
- Design and test engineering solutions to mitigate climate impacts.
- Advocate for climate justice through community engagement and action.
