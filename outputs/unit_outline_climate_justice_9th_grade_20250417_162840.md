## Unit Title: Climate Justice in Chicago: Understanding and Action

### Anchoring Phenomenon
The disproportionate impact of urban heat islands and air pollution in Chicago neighborhoods, particularly affecting communities of color.

### Driving Question
How can we address climate justice in Chicago to ensure equitable environmental health for all communities?

### Introduction
Students will begin the unit by examining temperature and air quality data from different neighborhoods in Chicago. They will explore how these environmental factors vary across the city and discuss why certain areas are more affected than others. This localized phenomenon will serve as a springboard for understanding the broader concepts of climate justice and environmental equity.

### Storyline Arc Summary
This unit will guide students through an exploration of climate justice, focusing on the local context of Chicago. Students will start by analyzing data on urban heat islands and air pollution, identifying patterns and disparities among neighborhoods. They will investigate the causes of these disparities, including historical redlining and industrial zoning practices. As students develop a deeper understanding of the science behind climate change and its social implications, they will engage in engineering practices to propose solutions that mitigate these effects. Throughout the unit, students will connect their learning to local initiatives and consider how they can contribute to climate action in their communities. The unit will culminate in a project where students design and present actionable plans to promote climate justice in Chicago.

### Lesson Sets
1. **Understanding Urban Heat Islands**: Students will explore the concept of urban heat islands, examining data from different Chicago neighborhoods to understand how and why temperatures vary across the city.
   
2. **Air Quality and Health**: This lesson will focus on the relationship between air quality and public health, with students analyzing local air quality data and discussing its impact on community health.
   
3. **Historical Context and Environmental Inequity**: Students will investigate the historical factors contributing to environmental inequities in Chicago, such as redlining and industrial zoning, and how these have affected current climate justice issues.
   
4. **Engineering Solutions for Climate Justice**: In this lesson, students will engage in engineering practices to design solutions that address the urban heat island effect and improve air quality in affected neighborhoods.
   
5. **Community Action and Advocacy**: Students will learn about local climate justice initiatives and develop their own advocacy projects to promote environmental equity in their communities.

### Notes on Integrating Cultivating Genius
- **Identity**: Encourage students to explore their own connections to climate justice issues and reflect on how their identities shape their perspectives.
- **Skill**: Develop critical thinking and data analysis skills through hands-on investigations and research projects.
- **Intellect**: Build knowledge of climate science and social justice, integrating interdisciplinary approaches.
- **Criticality**: Foster critical consciousness by examining power dynamics and advocating for equitable solutions.

### NGSS Performance Expectations
- HS-ESS3-1: Construct an explanation based on evidence for how the availability of natural resources, occurrence of natural hazards, and climate change have influenced human activity.
- HS-ESS3-4: Evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces impacts of human activities on natural systems.
- HS-ETS1-3: Evaluate a solution to a complex real-world problem based on prioritized criteria and trade-offs that account for a range of constraints.

### Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts
