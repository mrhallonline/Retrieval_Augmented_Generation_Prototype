## Unit Title: Climate Justice in Chicago

### Anchoring Phenomenon
Localized flooding in Chicago neighborhoods due to increased rainfall and inadequate infrastructure.

### Driving Question
How can we address climate justice issues in our community to ensure equitable protection and resilience for all residents?

### Introduction
On the first day, students will explore recent news articles and videos about flooding in various Chicago neighborhoods, focusing on how these events impact different communities. They will discuss personal experiences or stories from family members about how climate events have affected their lives. This will set the stage for understanding the broader concept of climate justice and its local implications.

### Storyline Arc Summary
This unit begins with students examining the localized phenomenon of flooding in Chicago, connecting it to broader climate change issues. They will investigate the science behind climate change, focusing on human contributions and the resulting impacts on weather patterns. The unit will then shift to exploring how these changes disproportionately affect marginalized communities, emphasizing the concept of climate justice. Students will engage in data analysis, examining local climate data and infrastructure maps to identify vulnerable areas. They will also explore engineering solutions and community action plans to mitigate these impacts. The unit concludes with students developing their own proposals for local climate justice initiatives, presenting them to the class and potentially to community stakeholders.

### Lesson Sets
1. **Understanding Climate Change**: Students will learn about the science of climate change, focusing on greenhouse gases and their effects on global and local climates. They will conduct experiments to visualize the greenhouse effect and analyze data trends over time.

2. **Impact on Communities**: This lesson focuses on how climate change affects different communities in Chicago, with an emphasis on Black and Latinx neighborhoods. Students will explore case studies and use GIS tools to map vulnerable areas.

3. **Engineering Solutions**: Students will investigate engineering solutions to mitigate flooding, such as green roofs and permeable pavements. They will engage in a design challenge to create a model of a flood-resistant neighborhood.

4. **Community Action and Advocacy**: This lesson will cover how communities can advocate for climate justice. Students will learn about local organizations and youth-led initiatives, discussing the importance of civic engagement.

5. **Developing Proposals**: In the final lesson, students will work in groups to develop proposals for local climate justice initiatives. They will present their ideas to the class and receive feedback.
