Affirm that both addressing the root cause and mitigating local impacts are important and urgent, and that science and engineering as well as social and political action are important to help save the oysters, the ecosystems, and the communities connected to oysters. ✱ ✱ ATTENDING TO EQUITY To cultivate critical hope (Duncan-Andrade, 2009) in the face of eco-anxiety, highlight forms of social and political action already underway "

Criticality is the capacity to read, write, and think in ways of understanding  power, privilege, social justice, and oppression, particularly for populations  who have been historically marginalized in the world (Muhammad, 2018). When youth have criticality, they are able to see, name, and interrogate  the world not only to make sense of injustice but also to work toward  social transformation. Thus, students need spaces to name and critique  injustice and ultimately have t"

This reflection is also an opportunity for students to show growth in their awareness of issues of social and environmental justice or in their understanding of how science connects to issues of justice in their community and world. openscied.or"

Display slide K and say, I heard many of you consider some great ideas about how we can be respectful when talking about people who have been forced to move. Others have attempted to think about this question too, and there are different terms proposed for this. Let’s take a look at some short excerpts from various sources of information so we can consider some different possibilities for how else we may want to refer to people who have been displaced by climate change. Invit"

Students revisit the definitions they recorded in their personal glossaries for criteria and nature-culture relations and revise as needed. Where We Are NOT Going This lesson does not address the climate change portion of DCI: HS LS2.C.2. This anthropogenic change will be addressed in OpenSciEd Unit B.2: What causes fires in ecosystems to burn and how should we manage th
10,OpenSciEd,C.4 Teacher Edition.pdf,"These global challenges also may have manifestations in local communities. Crossout Explanation: In OpenSciEd Unit C.5: How can chemistry help us evaluate fuels and transportation options to benefit the Earth and our communities? (Fuels Unit), students will examine strategies we are using to generate energy while reducing pollution (carbon dioxide emissions). Later in this unit, students will examine and read about interested parties and develop solutions for a particular community."
11,OpenSciEd,C.5 Teacher Edition.pdf,"That is A LOT of CO  and pollution. Climate change would be worse than it already is or will keep getting worse. More polar ice melt and sea-level rise. People would have to move. More ocean acidification. Higher temperatures might be dangerous for people and might make it harder to grow food, leading to famine. What might the impacts be on human migration if average temperatures continue to increase? Who would be affected and how? What might the impacts be on the size of the human population if"

Say, As I mentioned earlier, learning about the impacts of these fires and the historical events that led up to them may bring up feelings for you. I want to give everyone a chance to do a social and emotional check-in about these case studies. Encourage students to take a few minutes to turn and talk with a trusted peer, write independently in their science notebooks, or think about how they"

Emphasize that while increased temperature and carbon in the atmosphere are making wildfires harder to fight, we want to have hope for the future and take action. ✱ ATTENDING TO EQUITY This introductory discussion is important in order to reinforce the understanding that expertise about wildfires exists in many places and that many sources of knowledge are important in making decisions about how to manage these fires. It also addresses the nature of sci"
14,OpenSciEd,C.1 Teacher Edition.pdf,"These opportunities were built in throughout the unit. Furthermore, an important part of addressing climate anxiety is recognizing that there is hope. Lesson Sets 2 and 3 focus on helping students understand how people can work together to address the problem that humanity created by reducing carbon dioxide emissions and considering novel solutions that protect particular stretches of polar ice. What is the Learning in Places socio-ecological deliberation and decision-making framework? This unit"

Students will have experienced design problems that engaged them in a conservation mindset as they learned about the 30 by 30 Initiative in OpenSciEd Unit B.1: How do ecosystems work, and how can understanding them help us protect them? (Serengeti Unit). Some students may challenge the mindset and ethos around the inevitable use of resources from outer-space planetary bodies"
16,OpenSciEd,C.1 Teacher Edition.pdf,"Although energy cannot be destroyed, it can be converted to less useful forms—for example, to thermal energy in the surrounding environment. Students build the first two of these ideas as they ask questions of a computational model (SEP: 1.3) and use it to support claims (SEP: 5.2). This is students’ first assessed opportunity to ask questions about the relationships between variables in the course, although they have previously formulated hypotheses about the relationships between variables (in"

We’ve had really hot summers here, and there have been some fires because of the drought. I’m concerned about this getting worse. It is scary that temperatures keep rising. I’m starting to understand how small-scale actions can have big-scale consequences. What do you think would be productive for our classroom community to investigate next? Increasing temperature and carbon are disturbing. We want to find a solution or way"

The impact of climate change is a prominent theme in this unit. Youth feel sadness, fear, and anxiety about climate change (Hickman et al., 2021), and for students who have previously experienced trauma, this can have a compounding effect (Effects of complex trauma, NCTSN).
