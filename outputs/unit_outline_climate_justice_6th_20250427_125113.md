## Unit Outline: Climate Justice

### Title of the Unit
**Climate Justice: Understanding and Acting on Local and Global Impacts**

### Anchoring Phenomenon
**Localized flooding and its impact on ecosystems and communities in the Bay Area, particularly in Oakland.**

### Driving Question
**How can we understand and address the impacts of climate change on our local ecosystems and communities?**

### Introduction
On the first day, students will be introduced to the concept of climate justice through a localized lens. They will explore recent instances of flooding in Oakland and its effects on local ecosystems and communities. Students will engage with multimedia resources, including news clips and interviews with local residents, to understand the real-world implications of climate change in their area. This will set the stage for a deeper investigation into the science and social aspects of climate justice.

### Storyline Arc Summary
The unit begins with students exploring the immediate effects of climate change on their local environment, focusing on flooding in the Bay Area. As they delve deeper, they will learn about the scientific principles behind climate change, including the greenhouse effect and carbon cycles. Students will engage in hands-on activities and experiments to understand these concepts better. The unit will then shift to examining the social justice aspects, where students will learn about how climate change disproportionately affects marginalized communities, particularly Black and Latinx populations in Oakland. They will explore case studies and engage in discussions to develop a critical understanding of climate justice. The unit will culminate in a project where students propose actionable solutions to mitigate climate change impacts in their community, integrating scientific knowledge and social justice principles.

### Lesson Sets

**Lesson 1: Understanding Local Impacts**
Students will investigate recent flooding events in Oakland, analyzing data and maps to understand the affected areas. They will discuss how these events impact local ecosystems and communities, particularly marginalized groups. Students will use this context to explore the concept of climate justice and its relevance to their lives.

**Lesson 2: The Science of Climate Change**
In this lesson, students will conduct experiments to understand the greenhouse effect and carbon cycles. They will use models to visualize how human activities contribute to climate change. Students will work in groups to analyze data and draw connections between scientific concepts and the local phenomenon of flooding.

**Lesson 3: Social Justice and Climate Change**
Students will explore case studies of how climate change disproportionately affects marginalized communities. They will engage in discussions and role-playing activities to understand different perspectives and develop empathy. This lesson will emphasize the importance of social justice in addressing climate change.

**Lesson 4: Solutions and Action**
Students will brainstorm and research potential solutions to mitigate the impacts of climate change in their community. They will work in groups to develop proposals, considering both scientific and social aspects. Students will present their proposals to the class, receiving feedback and refining their ideas.

**Lesson 5: Community Engagement**
In the final lesson, students will engage with community members and local organizations to learn about ongoing climate justice initiatives. They will reflect on their learning and consider how they can contribute to these efforts. This lesson will emphasize the importance of community action and collaboration in addressing climate change.

### Key Investigations
1. **Flood Mapping and Analysis**: Students will use GIS tools to map recent flooding events in Oakland, analyzing patterns and identifying vulnerable areas.
2. **Greenhouse Effect Experiment**: A hands-on activity where students simulate the greenhouse effect using simple materials to visualize how it contributes to global warming.
3. **Carbon Cycle Modeling**: Students will create models to understand the carbon cycle and how human activities disrupt it, using data from local sources.
4. **Case Study Analysis**: Students will analyze case studies of climate justice issues, focusing on marginalized communities in the Bay Area.
5. **Community Solutions Workshop**: A collaborative session where students develop and present solutions to local climate change impacts, integrating scientific and social perspectives.

### Cultivating Genius Integration
- **Identity**: Students will explore their own connections to the local environment and how climate change affects their communities.
- **Skill**: The unit will develop students' scientific inquiry skills, data analysis, and critical thinking through hands-on activities and investigations.
- **Intellect**: Students will gain a deep understanding of climate science and social justice, connecting these concepts to real-world issues.
- **Criticality**: The unit will encourage students to question power structures and consider how they can contribute to social transformation through climate action.

### NGSS Performance Expectations
- MS-ESS3-3: Apply scientific principles to design a method for monitoring and minimizing a human impact on the environment.
- MS-ESS3-4: Construct an argument supported by evidence for how increases in human population and per-capita consumption of natural resources impact Earth's systems.

### Student Learning Objectives
- Understand the scientific principles behind climate change and its local impacts.
- Analyze data to identify patterns and draw conclusions about climate change effects.
- Develop empathy and understanding of how climate change affects marginalized communities.
- Propose actionable solutions to mitigate climate change impacts in their community.

### Common Student Misconceptions
- Climate change only affects distant places, not local communities.
- Human activities have no significant impact on climate change.
- Climate change solutions are only for scientists and policymakers, not individuals.

### Specific Questions to Surface Prior Knowledge
- What do you know about climate change and its effects on the environment?
- How have you or your community been affected by extreme weather events?
- What actions do you think can be taken to address climate change?

### Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts
- How did students engage with the localized phenomenon of flooding in Oakland?
- What evidence of understanding and empathy did students demonstrate in discussions about climate justice?
- How can I continue to support students in developing actionable solutions for climate change in their community?
