  "phenomenon": null,
  "driving_question": null,
  "summary": "The unit begins with students observing local weather patterns and their impact on their community. They will then investigate the causes of these changes, focusing on the greenhouse effect and human activities contributing to climate change. Students will explore the concept of climate justice, understanding how climate change disproportionately affects different communities, including their own. They will then research local initiatives addressing climate change and consider how these initiatives promote climate justice. Students will engage with local community members, climate activists, and policymakers to understand the ongoing efforts and challenges in achieving climate justice. The unit concludes with students proposing their own solutions to promote climate justice in their community, considering both scientific and socio-political aspects.",
