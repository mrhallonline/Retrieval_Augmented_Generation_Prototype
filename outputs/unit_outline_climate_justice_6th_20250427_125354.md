## Unit Outline: Climate Justice

### Title of the Unit
Climate Justice: Understanding and Acting on Local and Global Impacts

### Anchoring Phenomenon
The rising sea levels and increased frequency of wildfires affecting the Bay Area ecosystems, particularly impacting Black and Latinx communities in Oakland.

### Driving Question
How can we understand and address the impacts of climate change on our local ecosystems and communities?

### Introduction
On the first day, students will engage with a multimedia presentation showcasing the effects of climate change on the Bay Area, including rising sea levels and wildfires. This will include personal stories from community members affected by these changes, connecting students to the phenomenon through their own community's experiences.

### Storyline Arc Summary
The unit begins by introducing students to the concept of climate justice, emphasizing how climate change disproportionately affects marginalized communities. Students will explore the science behind climate change, focusing on local impacts in the Bay Area. They will investigate the role of ecosystems in mitigating climate effects and analyze data on local climate patterns. Throughout the unit, students will engage in problem-solving activities to design solutions that address climate impacts in their community. The unit concludes with students presenting their findings and proposed solutions to a panel of community stakeholders, fostering a sense of agency and empowerment.

### Lesson Sets

#### Lesson 1: Introduction to Climate Justice
Students will watch a documentary segment on climate change impacts in the Bay Area, followed by a class discussion on how these changes affect their community. They will create a mind map connecting climate change to local social justice issues. The goal is to build awareness and connect personal experiences to the broader phenomenon.

#### Lesson 2: Understanding Ecosystems and Climate Change
Students will explore local ecosystems, such as wetlands and forests, and their role in climate regulation. They will conduct a field study in a nearby park, collecting data on plant and animal species. This hands-on experience will help students understand the importance of biodiversity in climate resilience.

#### Lesson 3: Data Analysis and Local Climate Patterns
Students will analyze historical climate data from the Bay Area, identifying trends and patterns. They will use graphing tools to visualize changes in temperature and precipitation over time. This lesson aims to develop students' data literacy and critical thinking skills.

#### Lesson 4: Engineering Solutions for Climate Resilience
In groups, students will design a small-scale engineering project to address a local climate issue, such as reducing urban heat or preventing flooding. They will use the engineering design process to plan, prototype, and test their solutions. This lesson emphasizes creativity and collaboration.

#### Lesson 5: Community Engagement and Advocacy
Students will learn about community advocacy and the role of youth in climate action. They will prepare presentations on their projects and present them to local community leaders and stakeholders. This lesson aims to empower students to take action and engage with their community.

### Key Investigations

1. **Field Study of Local Ecosystems**: Students will investigate the biodiversity of a local park, collecting data on species diversity and ecosystem health.
   
2. **Climate Data Analysis**: Students will analyze temperature and precipitation data from the past 50 years to identify trends and make predictions about future climate impacts.

3. **Engineering Design Challenge**: Students will design and test a prototype solution to a local climate issue, such as a rain garden or green roof.

### Integration of Cultivating Genius
- **Identity**: Students explore their own cultural connections to the environment and how their community is affected by climate change.
- **Skill**: Emphasis on data analysis, engineering design, and public speaking.
- **Intellect**: Deep understanding of climate science and its local impacts.
- **Criticality**: Students critically examine social justice issues related to climate change and develop solutions that promote equity.

### NGSS Performance Expectations
- MS-ESS3-3: Apply scientific principles to design a method for monitoring and minimizing human impact on the environment.
- MS-ESS3-5: Ask questions to clarify evidence of the factors that have caused the rise in global temperatures over the past century.

### Student Learning Objectives
- Understand the science behind climate change and its local impacts.
- Analyze and interpret climate data to identify trends.
- Design and test solutions to mitigate local climate impacts.
- Engage with community stakeholders to advocate for climate justice.

### Common Student Misconceptions
- Climate change only affects polar regions, not local areas.
- Human actions cannot significantly impact climate change.
- Ecosystems are not connected to climate regulation.

### Specific Questions to Surface Prior Knowledge
- What do you know about climate change and its effects on our community?
- How do you think local ecosystems help in regulating climate?
- What actions can individuals or communities take to address climate change?

### Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts
- How did students connect their personal experiences to the climate justice issues discussed?
- What challenges did students face in understanding the data analysis process?
- How effectively did students engage with community stakeholders during their presentations?
