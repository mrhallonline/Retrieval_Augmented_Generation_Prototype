  "summary": "On the first day, students will explore recent news articles and videos about flooding in various Chicago neighborhoods, focusing on how these events impact different communities. They will discuss personal experiences or stories from family members about how climate events have affected their lives. This will set the stage for understanding the broader concept of climate justice and its local implications. This unit begins with students examining the localized phenomenon of flooding in Chicago, connecting it to broader climate change issues. They will investigate the science behind climate change, focusing on human contributions and the resulting impacts on weather patterns. The unit will then shift to exploring how these changes disproportionately affect marginalized communities, emphasizing the concept of climate justice. Students will engage in data analysis, examining local climate data and infrastructure maps to identify vulnerable areas. They will also explore engineering solutions and community action plans to mitigate these impacts. The unit concludes with students developing their own proposals for local climate justice initiatives, presenting them to the class and potentially to community stakeholders.",
