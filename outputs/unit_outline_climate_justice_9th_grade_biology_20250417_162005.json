  "summary": "On the first day, students will explore a recent news story about a severe flooding event in a South Side neighborhood. This will be followed by a discussion on personal experiences with climate-related events in their communities. Students will be encouraged to share stories from their families and neighbors, connecting personal and community experiences to the broader topic of climate justice. The unit begins with students examining the localized effects of climate change, such as flooding and heatwaves, in Chicago. They will investigate the scientific principles behind these phenomena, including weather patterns, greenhouse gases, and urban heat islands. As students progress, they will explore the concept of climate justice, focusing on how marginalized communities are disproportionately affected. The unit will incorporate data analysis and engineering practices as students design solutions to mitigate these impacts. Throughout, students will engage with community members and local organizations to understand ongoing efforts and develop their own action plans. The unit culminates in a community presentation where students propose solutions and advocate for policy changes.",
