1. Title of the Unit: "Climate Justice: Understanding and Addressing Climate Change in Our Community"

2. NGSS Anchoring Phenomenon: The noticeable changes in local weather patterns and the impact on the community's lifestyle and economy in Oakland, California.

3. Driving Question: "How does climate change affect our community in Oakland, California, and what can we do to promote climate justice?"

4. Summary of the Storyline Arc: 
The unit begins with students observing local weather patterns and their impact on their community. They will then investigate the causes of these changes, focusing on the greenhouse effect and human activities contributing to climate change. Students will explore the concept of climate justice, understanding how climate change disproportionately affects different communities, including their own. They will then research local initiatives addressing climate change and consider how these initiatives promote climate justice. Students will engage with local community members, climate activists, and policymakers to understand the ongoing efforts and challenges in achieving climate justice. The unit concludes with students proposing their own solutions to promote climate justice in their community, considering both scientific and socio-political aspects.

5. Lesson Sets:
   - Lesson Set 1: Understanding Weather and Climate: Students will learn the difference between weather and climate, and observe and record local weather patterns.
   - Lesson Set 2: The Science of Climate Change: Students will learn about the greenhouse effect, human activities contributing to climate change, and their impact on local and global climates.
   - Lesson Set 3: Climate Justice: Students will explore the concept of climate justice, understanding how climate change disproportionately affects different communities.
   - Lesson Set 4: Local Impact and Initiatives: Students will research and discuss the impact of climate change on their community and local initiatives addressing these issues.
   - Lesson Set 5: Advocating for Climate Justice: Students will engage with local community members and policymakers, propose their own solutions, and plan actions to promote climate justice.

6. Key Investigations:
   - Investigation 1: Observing Local Weather Patterns: Students will record and analyze local weather data over a period of time.
   - Investigation 2: Human Impact on Climate: Students will conduct experiments or simulations to understand the greenhouse effect and human-induced climate change.
   - Investigation 3: Climate Justice in Our Community: Students will research and present on how climate change has affected their community and existing local initiatives addressing these issues.
   - Investigation 4: Proposing Solutions: Students will propose and justify their own solutions to promote climate justice in their community.

7. NGSS Performance Expectations: MS-ESS3-3, MS-ESS3-4, MS-ESS3-5, HS-ESS3-1, HS-ESS3-4, HS-ESS3-5, HS-ESS3-6

8. Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts:
   - How did students' understanding of climate change and its local impact evolve throughout the unit?
   - In what ways did students connect their learning to their own lives and community context?
   - How effectively did students engage with the concept of climate justice?
   - How did students demonstrate their ability to propose viable solutions for promoting climate justice?
   - How can I better incorporate students' cultural identities and community experiences in future units?
