### Unit Outline: Climate Justice

1. **Title of the Unit:**
   - "Climate Justice: Empowering Change in Our Community"

2. **NGSS Anchoring Phenomenon:**
   - The increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires in California and their disproportionate impact on marginalized communities.

3. **Driving Question:**
   - How can we, as a community, address the impacts of climate change to promote environmental justice in Oakland?

4. **Summary of the Storyline Arc:**
   - This unit begins with students exploring the concept of climate change and its local manifestations, such as the recent wildfires in California. Students will investigate how these environmental changes disproportionately affect marginalized communities, particularly in urban areas like Oakland. Through examining local data and case studies, students will identify the social, economic, and health impacts of climate change on their community. The unit will then guide students to explore the concept of climate justice, emphasizing the importance of equitable solutions and community resilience. Students will engage with local organizations and stakeholders to understand ongoing efforts and challenges in addressing climate change. The unit culminates in a project where students propose actionable solutions to promote climate justice in their community, integrating scientific understanding with cultural and social perspectives.

5. **List of 3–5 Lesson Sets:**

   - **Lesson Set 1: Understanding Climate Change**
     - Students will explore the scientific basis of climate change, focusing on greenhouse gases and their role in global warming. They will analyze climate data and models to understand trends and predictions, with a focus on local impacts in California.

   - **Lesson Set 2: Local Impacts and Community Vulnerability**
     - This set will focus on the specific impacts of climate change in Oakland, such as air quality issues from wildfires and heatwaves. Students will investigate how these impacts are experienced differently across various communities, highlighting issues of equity and vulnerability.

   - **Lesson Set 3: The Concept of Climate Justice**
     - Students will delve into the principles of climate justice, exploring historical and contemporary examples of environmental injustices. They will discuss the role of policy and advocacy in promoting equitable solutions.

   - **Lesson Set 4: Engaging with Community Stakeholders**
     - Students will interact with local organizations and experts working on climate issues in Oakland. They will learn about community-led initiatives and the importance of diverse perspectives in addressing climate challenges.

   - **Lesson Set 5: Designing Solutions for Climate Justice**
     - In the final lesson set, students will work collaboratively to design and propose solutions that address climate justice in their community. They will present their projects to peers and community members for feedback and potential implementation.

6. **List of 3–5 Key Investigations:**

   - **Investigation 1: Analyzing Local Climate Data**
     - Students will analyze historical and current climate data for Oakland, identifying trends and making predictions about future impacts. They will use this data to understand the local context of climate change.

   - **Investigation 2: Case Study on Wildfires and Air Quality**
     - Students will conduct a case study on recent wildfires in California, examining their causes, effects on air quality, and health impacts on different communities.

   - **Investigation 3: Mapping Community Vulnerability**
     - Using GIS tools, students will map areas in Oakland that are most vulnerable to climate impacts, considering factors such as socioeconomic status and access to resources.

   - **Investigation 4: Interviews with Community Leaders**
     - Students will conduct interviews with local leaders and activists to gain insights into ongoing efforts and challenges in promoting climate justice in Oakland.

   - **Investigation 5: Solution Design and Prototyping**
     - Students will design prototypes of their proposed solutions, using scientific principles and community feedback to refine their ideas.

7. **NGSS Performance Expectations:**
   - HS-ESS3-1: Construct an explanation based on evidence for how the availability of natural resources, occurrence of natural hazards, and climate change have influenced human activity.
   - HS-ESS3-4: Evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces impacts of human activities on natural systems.
   - HS-ESS3-5: Analyze geoscience data and the results from global climate models to make an evidence-based forecast of the current rate of global or regional climate change and associated future impacts to Earth systems.

8. **Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts:**
   - How did students engage with the concept of climate justice, and what connections did they make to their own lives and community?
