1. **Title of the Unit**: Climate Justice: Understanding and Addressing Local Impacts

2. **Anchoring Phenomenon**: The disproportionate impact of climate change on marginalized communities in Oakland, California, such as increased heatwaves, poor air quality, and rising sea levels affecting coastal areas.

3. **Driving Question**: How can we use science and engineering practices to understand and address the local impacts of climate change on marginalized communities in Oakland?

4. **Introduction**: Students will be introduced to the unit through a discussion about their observations of climate change impacts in their local community. They will be guided to connect these observations to broader climate justice issues.

5. **Storyline Arc Summary**: The unit begins with an exploration of the local impacts of climate change in Oakland. Students then investigate the science behind these changes and the societal factors contributing to climate injustice. The unit culminates in a project where students propose solutions to address these issues in their community, integrating science and engineering practices with social action.

6. **Lesson Sets**:
   - Lesson 1: Observing Local Climate Impacts
   - Lesson 2: Understanding the Science of Climate Change
   - Lesson 3: Exploring the Social Factors of Climate Injustice

   - Week 1: Introduction to climate justice and local impacts (Identity)
   - Week 2: Deep dive into the science of climate change (Skill, Intellect)
   - Week 3: Exploration of social factors contributing to climate injustice (Criticality)
   - Week 4: Investigation of potential solutions (Skill, Intellect)
   - Week 5: Design and presentation of community action plans (Identity, Criticality)

8. **NGSS Performance Expectations**: HS-ESS3 Earth and Human Activity, HS-ETS1 Engineering Design

9. **Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts**:
   - How did students connect their personal experiences to the concept of climate justice?
   - What skills did students develop throughout this unit?
   - How did students demonstrate criticality in their understanding of climate injustice?
   - How can I improve the integration of the Cultivating Genius framework in future units?
