1. **Title of the Unit:** "Understanding Biological Sex, Gender, and Genetic Mutations: A Biological and Sociocultural Exploration"

2. **NGSS Anchoring Phenomenon:** The variation in physical characteristics and athletic abilities among individuals due to differences in biological sex and the impact of genetic mutations.

3. **Driving Question:** How do biological sex and gender differ, and how can genetic mutations affect the development of sex characteristics and athletic performance?

4. **Summary of the Storyline Arc:** The unit begins by exploring the concepts of biological sex and gender, emphasizing their differences and societal implications. Students then delve into the role of genes in determining biological sex and how mutations can affect the development of sex characteristics. They will examine real-world examples of genetic mutations and their impacts on individuals. The unit then transitions to the influence of biological sex on athletic performance, exploring physiological differences and their effects on various sports. The unit concludes with a discussion on the societal and ethical implications of these biological differences in sports and other areas of life.

5. **Lesson Sets:**
   - Lesson 1: Introduction to Biological Sex and Gender: This lesson introduces students to the concepts of biological sex and gender, highlighting their differences and societal constructs around them.
   - Lesson 2: Role of Genes in Determining Biological Sex: Students explore the role of genes in determining biological sex, including the X and Y chromosomes.
   - Lesson 3: Genetic Mutations and Sex Characteristics: This lesson delves into how genetic mutations can affect the development of sex characteristics, using real-world examples.
   - Lesson 4: Biological Sex and Athletic Performance: Students investigate how biological sex can influence athletic performance, examining physiological differences.
   - Lesson 5: Societal and Ethical Implications: The final lesson involves a discussion on the societal and ethical implications of biological sex differences in sports and other areas of life.

6. **Key Investigations:**
   - Investigation 1: Research on Genetic Mutations: Students research real-world examples of genetic mutations affecting sex characteristics.
   - Investigation 2: Case Study Analysis: Students analyze case studies of athletes with different biological sex characteristics and their performances.
   - Investigation 3: Debate on Ethical Implications: Students participate in a debate on the ethical implications of biological sex differences in sports.

7. **NGSS Performance Expectations:** HS-LS1-4, HS-LS3-1, HS-LS3-2

8. **Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts:**
   - How did students respond to the differentiation between biological sex and gender? 
   - Were students able to understand and explain the role of genes in determining biological sex?
   - How effectively did students apply their understanding of genetic mutations to real-world examples?
   - Did students demonstrate a clear understanding of the influence of biological sex on athletic performance?
   - Were students able to engage in thoughtful discussion about the societal and ethical implications of biological sex differences?
