1. Title of the Unit: "Biological Sex, Gender, and Genetic Variations: Understanding Our Differences"

2. NGSS Anchoring Phenomenon: The diversity of biological sex characteristics and the influence of genetic mutations on these characteristics. 

3. Driving Question: How do biological sex and gender differ, and how can genetic mutations affect the development of internal and external sex characteristics? How do these characteristics potentially influence athletic performance?

4. Summary of the storyline arc: The unit begins by distinguishing between biological sex and gender, emphasizing that gender is a social construct and varies across cultures. Students then delve into the genetic basis of biological sex, exploring how chromosomes determine sex and how genetic mutations can lead to variations in sex characteristics. The unit then explores how these biological differences can potentially influence athletic performance, challenging students to consider the complexities of this issue. Throughout the unit, students will engage in hands-on investigations, data analysis, and model development to deepen their understanding. The unit will also emphasize the importance of inclusivity and respect for diversity, encouraging students to consider these issues from a culturally responsive perspective.

5. Lesson Sets: 
   - Lesson Set 1: "Distinguishing Between Biological Sex and Gender" - Students explore the differences between biological sex and gender, learning about the cultural and societal implications of gender.
   - Lesson Set 2: "The Genetics of Biological Sex" - Students delve into the genetic basis of biological sex, exploring how chromosomes determine sex.
   - Lesson Set 3: "Genetic Mutations and Sex Characteristics" - Students investigate how genetic mutations can lead to variations in sex characteristics.
   - Lesson Set 4: "Biological Sex and Athletic Performance" - Students explore the potential influence of biological sex characteristics on athletic performance.
   - Lesson Set 5: "Respecting Diversity and Promoting Inclusivity" - Students reflect on the importance of respecting diversity and promoting inclusivity in the context of biological sex and gender.

6. Key Investigations: 
   - Investigation 1: "Exploring Chromosomes and Sex Determination" - Students use models to understand how chromosomes determine biological sex.
   - Investigation 2: "Investigating Genetic Mutations" - Students analyze data on genetic mutations and their impact on sex characteristics.
   - Investigation 3: "Analyzing the Influence of Biological Sex on Athletic Performance" - Students analyze data to explore the potential influence of biological sex characteristics on athletic performance.

7. NGSS Performance Expectations: 
   - HS-LS1-4: Use a model to illustrate the role of cellular division (mitosis) and differentiation in producing and maintaining complex organisms.
   - HS-LS3-1: Ask questions to clarify relationships about the role of DNA and chromosomes in coding the instructions for characteristic traits passed from parents to offspring.
   - HS-LS3-2: Make and defend a claim based on evidence that inheritable genetic variations may result from: (1) new genetic combinations through meiosis, (2) viable errors occurring during replication, and/or (3) mutations caused by environmental factors.

8. Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts: 
   - How did students respond to the distinction between biological sex and gender? 
   - Were students able to understand and explain the genetic basis of biological sex and the role of genetic mutations in sex characteristics? 
   - How did students engage with the discussion on biological sex and athletic performance? 
   - How effectively did the unit promote respect for diversity and inclusivity? 
   - How can the unit be improved to better reflect the students' cultural identities and community experiences?
