<h3>Question: What are the main goals of K-12 science education according to this framework?</h3>
<h4>Answer:</h4>
<p>The main goals of K-12 science education according to this framework include educating all students in science and engineering, providing foundational knowledge for those who may pursue careers in science, engineering, technology, and motivating and inspiring a diverse population to pursue these paths. This framework aims to help students engage in public discussions on science-related issues, be critical consumers of scientific information in their everyday lives, continue learning about science throughout their lives, and understand the importance of science and engineering in addressing societal challenges.</p>

ited to) careers in science, engineering, and technology.
Currently, K-12 science education in the United States fails to achieve these 
outcomes, in part because it is not organized systematically across multiple years 
of school, emphasizes discrete facts with a focus on breadth over depth, and 
does not provide students with engaging opportunities to experience how science 
is actually done. The framework is designed to directly address and overcome 
these weaknesses.

A Framework for K-12 Science Education
The framework is based on a rich and growing body of research on teaching 
and learning in science, as well as on nearly two decades of efforts to define founda-
tional knowledge and skills for K-12 science and engineering. From this work, the 
committee concludes that K-12 science and engineering education should focus on 
a limited number of disciplinary core ideas and crosscutting concepts, be designed 
so that students continually build on and revise their knowledge and abilities over 
multiple years, and support the integration of such knowledge and abilities with the 
practices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design. 
The committee recommends that science education in grades K-12 be built 
around three major dimensions (see Box S-1 for details of each dimension). These 
dimensions are
•	
Scientific and engineering practices
•	
Crosscutting concepts that unify the study of science and engineering 
through their common application across fields
•	
Core ideas in four disciplinary areas: physical sciences; life sciences; earth 
and space sciences; and engineering, technology, and applications of science 
To support students’ meaningful learning in science and engineering, all 
three dimensions need to be integrated into standards, curriculum, instruction, and 
assessment. Engineering and technology are featured alongside the natural sciences 
(physical sciences, life sciences, and earth and space sciences) for two critical rea-
sons: (1) to reflect the importance of understanding the human-built world and (2) 
to recognize the value of better integrating the teaching and learning of science, 
engineering, and technology. 
The broad set of expectations for students articulated in the framework is

cations of science reflects an increasing emphasis at the national level on con-
sidering connections among science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. 
It is also informed by a recent report from the NRC on engineering education 
in K-12, which highlights the linkages—which go both ways—between learn-
ing science and learning engineering. Just as new science enables or sometimes 
demands new technologies, new technologies 
enable new scientific investigations, allowing 
scientists to probe realms and handle quanti-
ties of data previously inaccessible to them. 
Moreover, the line between applied sci-
ence and engineering is fuzzy. It is impossible 
to do engineering today without applying 
science in the process, and, in many areas of 
science, designing and building new experi-
ments requires scientists to engage in some 
engineering practices. This interplay of sci-
ence and engineering makes it appropriate to 
place engineering and technology as part of 
the science framework at the K-12 level. In 
this way, students can better see how science and engineering pertain to real-world 
problems and explore opportunities to apply their scientific knowledge to engi-
neering design problems once this linkage is made. 
Finally, our effort to identify a small number of core ideas may disappoint 
some scientists and educators who find little or nothing of their favorite science 
topics included in the framework. But the committee is convinced that by building

a strong base of core knowledge and competencies, understood in sufficient depth 
to be used, students will leave school better grounded in scientific knowledge and 
practices—and with greater interest in further learning in science—than when 
instruction “covers” multiple disconnected pieces of information that are memo-
rized and soon forgotten once the test is over.

core ideas. 
By the end of the 12th grade, students should have gained sufficient knowl-
edge of the practices, crosscutting concepts, and core ideas of science and engi-
neering to engage in public discussions on science-related issues, to be critical 
consumers of scientific information related to their everyday lives, and to continue 
to learn about science throughout their lives. They should come to appreciate 
that science and the current scientific understanding of the world are the result of 
many hundreds of years of creative human endeavor. It is especially important to 
note that the above goals are for all students, not just those who pursue careers in 
science, engineering, or technology or those who continue on to higher education.
We anticipate that the insights gained and interests provoked from study-
ing and engaging in the practices of science and engineering during their K-12 
schooling should help students see how science and engineering are instrumental 
in addressing major challenges that confront society today, such as generating 
sufficient energy, preventing and treating diseases, maintaining supplies of clean 
water and food, and solving the problems of global environmental change. In 
addition, although not all students will choose to pursue careers in science, engi-
neering, or technology, we hope that a science education based on the framework 
will motivate and inspire a greater number of people—and a better representation

of the broad diversity of the American population—to follow these paths than is 
the case today.
The committee’s vision takes into account two major goals for K-12 science 
education: (1) educating all students in science and engineering and (2) providing 
the foundational knowledge for those who will become the scientists, engineers, 
technologists, and technicians of the future. The framework principally concerns 
itself with the first task—what all students should know in preparation for their 
individual lives and for their roles as citizens in this technology-rich and scientifi-
cally complex world. Course options, including Advanced Placement (AP) or hon-
ors courses, should be provided that allow for greater breadth or depth in the sci-

<h3>Question: What role does equity play in the proposed science framework?</h3>
<h4>Answer:</h4>
<p>Equity plays a significant role in the proposed science framework as it is emphasized that concerns about equity should be at the forefront of any effort to improve the goals, structures, and practices that support learning and educational attainment for all students. The framework aims to ensure and evaluate educational equity, particularly in the context of science and engineering education. It stresses providing equitable opportunities for all students to learn science and engage in science and engineering practices, access quality resources and teachers, and connect to their interests and experiences to promote broader participation in science. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance learning about science and the world while embracing diversity to support educational equity for students from all backgrounds.</p>

occupations requires a more equitable achievement of science and engineering 
WHAT IS EQUITY?
The term “equity” has been used in different ways by different communities of researchers and educators. Equity 
as an expression of socially enlightened self-interest is reflected in calls to invest in the science and engineering 
education of underrepresented groups simply because American labor needs can no longer be met by recruiting 
among the traditional populations. Equity as an expression of social justice is manifested in calls to remedy the 
injustices visited on entire groups of American society that in the past have been underserved by their schools 
and have thereby suffered severely limited prospects of high-prestige careers in science and engineering. Other 
notions of equity are expressed throughout the education literature; all are based on the commonsense idea of 
fairness—what is inequitable is unfair. Fairness is sometimes considered to mean offering equal opportunity to 
all. The most commonly used definition of equity, as influenced by the U.S. Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board of 
Education (1954, 1955) and Lau v. Nichols (1974), frames equity in terms of equal treatment of all.

literacy [2, 3]. All students should be able to learn about the broad set of pos-
sibilities that modern life offers and to pursue their aspirations, including their 
occupations of interest. 
Considering Sources of Inequity
Today there are profound differences among specific demographic groups in 
their educational achievements and patterns of science learning, as in other sub-
ject matter areas. The reasons for these differences are complex, and research-
ers and educators have advanced a variety of explanations. We cannot address 
all of them in this chapter, so we focus instead on two key areas. The first links 
differences in achievement to differences in opportunities to learn because of 
inequities across schools, districts, and communities. The second considers how 
approaches to instruction can be made more inclusive and motivating for diverse 
student populations. 
Other sources of inequity that are important but beyond the scope of this

pose themselves at different ages. Such questions as “Where do we come from?,” 
“Why is the sky blue?,” and “What is the smallest piece of matter?” are funda-
mental hooks that engage young people. Framing a curriculum around such sets of 
questions helps to communicate relevance and salience to this audience.
Promoting Equity
Equity in science education requires that all students are provided with equitable 
opportunities to learn science and become engaged in science and engineering 
practices; with access to quality space, equipment, and teachers to support and 
motivate that learning and engagement; and adequate time spent on science. In 
addition, the issue of connecting to students’ interests and experiences is particu-
larly important for broadening participation in science. There is increasing recog-
nition that the diverse customs and orientations that members of different cultural 
communities bring both to formal and to informal science learning contexts are 
assets on which to build—both for the benefit of the student and ultimately of sci-
ence itself. For example, researchers have documented that children reared in rural 
agricultural communities, who experience intense and regular interactions with 
plants and animals, develop more sophisticated understanding of ecology and bio-
logical species than do urban and suburban children of the same age [31-33].

Others have identified connections between children’s culturally based sto-
rytelling and their engagement in argumentation and science inquiry, and some of 
these researchers have also documented pedagogical means of using such connec-
tions to support students’ 
science learning and promote 
educational equity [34]. 
The research demonstrates 
the importance of embrac-
ing diversity as a means of 
enhancing learning about 
science and the world, espe-
cially as society in the United 
States becomes progressively 
more diverse with respect to 
language, ethnicity, and race.

ommunities expect many things from their K-12 schools, among them the 
development of students’ disciplinary knowledge, upward social mobility, 
socialization into the local community and broader culture, and prepara-
tion for informed citizenship. Because schools face many constraints and persistent 
challenges in delivering this broad mandate for all students, one crucial role of a 
framework and its subject matter standards is to help ensure and evaluate educa-
tional equity. In the committee’s judgment, concerns about equity should be at the 
forefront of any effort to improve the goals, structures, and practices that support 
learning and educational attainment for all students. See Box 11-1 for a discussion 
of different interpretations of equity.

<h3>Question: What does the framework say about integrating engineering into science education?</h3>
<h4>Answer:</h4>
<p>The framework emphasizes the importance of integrating engineering into science education for two critical reasons: to reflect the significance of understanding the human-built world, and to acknowledge the value of better integrating the teaching and learning of science, engineering, and technology. It highlights that engineering involves a combination of knowledge and practices, with the main goal of solving problems driven by specific human needs or desires. The framework recommends incorporating both engineering practices and engineering core ideas to help students develop an understanding of engineering as a discipline and a potential career path.</p>
<h4>Retrieved Chunks:</h4>
<pre style='background:#f5f5f5;padding:10px;border:1px solid #ddd;'><strong>Chunk 1:</strong>
Similarly, engineering involves both knowledge and a set of practices. 
The major goal of engineering is to solve problems that arise from a specific 
human need or desire. To do this, engineers rely on their knowledge of science 
and mathematics as well as their understanding of the engineering design pro-
cess. Defining and solving the problem, that is, specifying what is needed and 
designing a solution for it, are the parts of engineering on which we focus in this 
framework, both because they provide students a place to practice the appli-
cation of their understanding of science and because the design process is an 
important way for K-12 students to develop an understanding of engineering as 
❚ Science is not just a body of knowledge that reflects current 
understanding of the world; it is also a set of practices used to establish, 
extend, and refine that knowledge. ❚

a discipline and as a possible career path. The work of engineers, like the work 
of scientists, involves both individual and cooperative effort; and it requires spe-
cialized knowledge. Hence, we include both engineering practices and engineer-
ing core ideas in this framework.
Connecting to Students’ Interests and Experiences
A rich science education has the potential to capture students’ sense of wonder 
about the world and to spark their desire to continue learning about science 
throughout their lives. Research suggests that personal interest, experience, and 
enthusiasm—critical to children’s learning of science at school or in other set-
tings—may also be linked to later educational and career choices [27-30]. Thus, 
in order for students to develop a sustained attraction to science and for them 
to appreciate the many ways in which it is pertinent to their daily lives, class-
room learning experiences in science need to connect with their own interests 
and experiences. 
As a strategy for building on prior interest, the disciplinary core ideas identi-
fied here are described not only with an eye toward the knowledge that students 
bring with them to school but also toward the kinds of questions they are likely to

levels, to consider not only the applications and implications of science and engi-
neering in society but also the nature of the human endeavor of science and 
engineering themselves. They likewise need to develop an awareness of the careers 
made possible through scientific and engineering capabilities. 
❚ Through discussion and reflection, students can come to realize that 
scientific inquiry embodies a set of values. These values include respect for 
the importance of logical thinking, precision, open-mindedness, objectivity, 
skepticism, and a requirement for transparent research procedures and 
honest reporting of findings. ❚

Implementation: Curriculum, Instruction, Teacher Development, and Assessment
Discussions involving the history of scientific and engineering ideas, of 
individual practitioners’ contributions, and of the applications of these endeav-
ors are important components of a science and engineering curriculum. For 
many students, these aspects are the pathways that capture their interest in these 
fields and build their identities as engaged and capable learners of science and 
engineering [34, 35]. Teaching science and engineering without reference to 
their rich variety of human stories, to the puzzles of the past and how they were 
solved, and to the issues of today that science and engineering must help address 
would be a major omission. It would isolate science and engineering from their 
human roots, undervalue their intellectual and creative contributions, and dimin-
ish many students’ interest. 
Finally, when considering how to integrate these aspects of learning into 
the science and engineering curriculum, curriculum developers, as well as class-
room teachers, face many 
further important questions. 
For example, is a topic best 
addressed by invoking its his-
torical development as a story 
of scientific discovery? Is it 
best addressed in the context 
of a current problem or issue? 
Or is it best conveyed through 
an investigation? What tech-
nology or simulation tools 
can aid student learning? In 
addition, how are diverse stu-
dent backgrounds explicitly 
engaged as resources in struc-
turing learning experiences

outcomes, in part because it is not organized systematically across multiple years
