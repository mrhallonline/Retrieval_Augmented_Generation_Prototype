All rights reserved.<br>ix<br>A <br>Framework for K-12 Science Education represents the first step in a <br>process to create new standards in K-12 science education. This project <br>capitalizes on a major opportunity that exists at this moment—a large <br>number of states are adopting common standards in mathematics and English/<br>language arts and thus are poised to consider adoption of common standards in <br>K-12 science education. The impetus for this project grew from the recognition <br></span><span style="background-color: #BDB2FF;" title="Chunk 6 | Start: 12507 | End: 14843 | Tokens: 501">that, although the existing national documents on science content for grades K-12 <br>(developed in the early to mid-1990s) were an important step in strengthening <br>science education, there is much room for improvement. Not only has science pro-<br>gressed, but the education community has learned important lessons from 10 years <br>of implementing standards-based education, and there is a new and growing body <br>of research on learning and teaching in science that can inform a revision of the <br>standards and revitalize science education.<br>In this context, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, together with the <br>Institute for Advanced Study, established a commission that issued a report enti-<br>tled The Opportunity Equation, calling for a common set of standards in science <br>to be developed. The Carnegie Corporation has taken a leadership role to ensure <br>that the development of common science standards proceeds and is of the highest <br>quality by funding a two-step process: first, the development of this framework <br>by the National Research Council (NRC) and, second, the development of a next <br>generation of science standards based on the framework led by Achieve, Inc. We <br>are grateful for the financial support of the Carnegie Corporation for this project <br>FOREWORD<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>x<br>Foreword<br>and for their vision in establishing the partnership and two-step process for devel-<br>oping the new standards.<br>This framework builds on the strong foundation of previous studies that <br>sought to identify and describe the major ideas for K-12 science education. These <br>include Science for All Americans and Benchmarks for Science Literacy (1993), <br>developed by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), <br>and the National Science Education Standards (1996), developed by the NRC. <br>The framework is also informed by more recent work of two of our partner orga-<br>nizations: the AAAS (in Project 2061 especially) and the National Science Teachers <br>Association (particularly the 2009 Anchors project). Achieve, Inc., our third part-<br>ner is this endeavor, will lead the development of next-generation standards for <br>science education based on the framework presented in this report with the aspi-<br></span><span style="background-color: #FFC6FF;" title="Chunk 7 | Start: 14843 | End: 17194 | Tokens: 498">ration that many states will choose to adopt them. We look forward to working <br>with these organizations in the dissemination and implementation of the vision of <br>science and engineering education that the framework embodies.<br>The framework highlights the power of integrating understanding the ideas <br>of science with engagement in the practices of science and is designed to build <br>students’ proficiency and appreciation for science over multiple years of school. <br>Of particular note is the prominent place given to the ideas and practices of <br>engineering. <br>As presidents of the National Academy of Sciences and National Academy <br>of Engineering, we are pleased to convey this report to interested readers. We <br>believe that the education of the children of this nation is a vital national concern. <br>The understanding of, and interest in, science and engineering that its citizens <br>bring to bear in their personal and civic decision making is critical to good deci-<br>sions about the nation’s future. The percentage of students who are motivated <br>by their school and out-of-school experiences to pursue careers in these fields is <br>currently too low for the nation’s needs. Moreover, an ever-larger number of jobs <br>require skills in these areas, along with those in language arts and mathematics. <br>We thank the committee and the many consultants and NRC staff members <br>who contributed to this effort, as well as the thousands who took the time to <br>comment on the draft that was made public in July 2010. That input contributed <br>substantially to the quality of this final report.<br>Ralph J. Cicerone, President, National Academy of Sciences<br>Charles M.

We begin by acknowledging the generous support <br>of the Carnegie Corporation of New York, and particularly Andrés Henriquez, for <br>his attention to and patience with this project.<br>Next we recognize the importance of the partnership we developed with <br>Achieve, Inc., the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFADAD;" title="Chunk 8 | Start: 17194 | End: 19524 | Tokens: 505">National Science Teachers Association, and we are pleased to be continuing this <br>partnership. Each organization brought its unique perspective to our many partner <br>meetings, which led to a stronger report and better communication with the myri-<br>ad communities with an interest in K-12 science education. Each of these partners <br>has an important role to play as the implementation of ideas in the framework <br>develops.<br>This report would not have been possible without the work of many indi-<br>viduals, teams, and organizations, and we hope we acknowledge them all here. <br>The four design teams (listed in Appendix D) were critical in the development of <br>the framework and providing the committee with insightful and creative models <br>for organizing the core ideas. We are deeply indebted to them and especially to <br>the four team leaders: Rodger Bybee, Joseph Krajcik, Cary Sneider, and Michael <br>Wysession. These team leaders worked closely with the committee until the <br>final stages of the project, tirelessly revising drafts of their work, discussing the <br>research, debating possible approaches, and consistently going above and beyond <br>their initial commitments. The work would have been impossible without them.<br>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

All rights reserved.<br>1<br>SUMMARY<br>S<br>cience, engineering, and technology permeate nearly every facet of modern <br>life, and they also hold the key to meeting many of humanity’s most press-<br>ing current and future challenges. Yet too few U.S. workers have strong <br>backgrounds in these fields, and many people lack even fundamental knowledge <br>of them. This national trend has created a widespread call for a new approach to <br>K-12 science education in the United States. <br>The Committee on a Conceptual Framework for New K-12 Science <br>Education Standards was charged with developing a framework that articulates <br>a broad set of expectations for students in science. The overarching goal of our <br>framework for K-12 science education is to ensure that by the end of 12th grade, <br>all students have some appreciation of the beauty and wonder of science; possess <br>sufficient knowledge of science and engineering to engage in public discussions on <br>related issues; are careful consumers of scientific and technological information <br>related to their everyday lives; are able to continue to learn about science outside <br>school; and have the skills to enter careers of their choice, including (but not lim-<br></span><span style="background-color: #A0C4FF;" title="Chunk 13 | Start: 28524 | End: 30943 | Tokens: 499">ited to) careers in science, engineering, and technology.<br>Currently, K-12 science education in the United States fails to achieve these <br>outcomes, in part because it is not organized systematically across multiple years <br>of school, emphasizes discrete facts with a focus on breadth over depth, and <br>does not provide students with engaging opportunities to experience how science <br>is actually done. The framework is designed to directly address and overcome <br>these weaknesses.<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>2<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>The framework is based on a rich and growing body of research on teaching <br>and learning in science, as well as on nearly two decades of efforts to define founda-<br>tional knowledge and skills for K-12 science and engineering. From this work, the <br>committee concludes that K-12 science and engineering education should focus on <br>a limited number of disciplinary core ideas and crosscutting concepts, be designed <br>so that students continually build on and revise their knowledge and abilities over <br>multiple years, and support the integration of such knowledge and abilities with the <br>practices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design. <br>The committee recommends that science education in grades K-12 be built <br>around three major dimensions (see Box S-1 for details of each dimension). These <br>dimensions are<br>•	<br>Scientific and engineering practices<br>•	<br>Crosscutting concepts that unify the study of science and engineering <br>through their common application across fields<br>•	<br>Core ideas in four disciplinary areas: physical sciences; life sciences; earth <br>and space sciences; and engineering, technology, and applications of science <br>To support students’ meaningful learning in science and engineering, all <br>three dimensions need to be integrated into standards, curriculum, instruction, and <br>assessment. Engineering and technology are featured alongside the natural sciences <br>(physical sciences, life sciences, and earth and space sciences) for two critical rea-<br>sons: (1) to reflect the importance of understanding the human-built world and (2) <br>to recognize the value of better integrating the teaching and learning of science, <br>engineering, and technology. <br>The broad set of expectations for students articulated in the framework is <br></span><span style="background-color: #BDB2FF;" title="Chunk 14 | Start: 30943 | End: 33126 | Tokens: 510">intended to guide the development of new standards that in turn guide revisions to <br>science-related curriculum, instruction, assessment, and professional development <br>for educators. A coherent and consistent approach throughout grades K-12 is <br>key to realizing the vision for science and engineering education embodied in the <br>framework: that students, over multiple years of school, actively engage in science <br>and engineering practices and apply crosscutting concepts to deepen their under-<br>standing of each field’s disciplinary core ideas. <br>The framework represents the first step in a process that should inform <br>state-level decisions and provide a research-grounded basis for improving sci-<br>ence teaching and learning across the country.

Although there is little doubt that this <br>need is genuine, a compelling case can also be made that understanding science <br>and engineering, now more than ever, is essential for every American citizen. <br>Science, engineering, and the technologies they influence permeate every aspect <br>of modern life. Indeed, some knowledge of science and engineering is required to <br>engage with the major public policy issues of today as well as to make informed <br>everyday decisions, such as selecting among alternative medical treatments or <br>determining how to invest public funds for water supply options. In addition, <br>understanding science and the extraordinary insights it has produced can be <br>meaningful and relevant on a personal level, opening new worlds to explore <br>and offering lifelong opportunities for enriching people’s lives. In these contexts, <br>learning science is important for everyone, even those who eventually choose <br>careers in fields other than science or engineering.<br> <br>A NEW CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK<br>1<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>8<br>The conceptual framework presented in this report of the Committee on a <br>Conceptual Framework for New K-12 Science Education Standards articulates the <br>committee’s vision of the scope and nature of the education in science, engineer-<br>ing, and technology needed for the 21st century. It is intended as a guide to the <br>next step, which is the process of developing standards for all students. Thus it <br>describes the major practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas <br>that all students should be familiar with by the end of high school, and it provides <br>an outline of how these practices, concepts, and ideas should be developed across <br>the grade levels. Engineering and technology are featured alongside the physical <br>sciences, life sciences, and earth and space sciences for two critical reasons: to <br>reflect the importance of understanding the human-built world and to recognize <br>the value of better integrating the teaching and learning of science, engineering, <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFD6A5;" title="Chunk 17 | Start: 37924 | End: 40299 | Tokens: 492">and technology.<br>By framework we mean a broad description of the content and sequence <br>of learning expected of all students by the completion of high school—but not at <br>the level of detail of grade-by-grade standards or, at the high school level, course <br>descriptions and standards. Instead, as this document lays out, the framework <br>is intended as a guide to standards developers as well as for curriculum design-<br>ers, assessment developers, state and district science administrators, profession-<br>als responsible for science teacher education, and science educators working in <br>informal settings. <br>There are two primary reasons why a new framework is needed at this time. <br>One is that it has been 15 or more years since the last comparable effort at the <br>national scale, and new understandings both in science and in teaching and learn-<br>ing science have developed over that time. The second is the opportunity provided <br>by a movement of multiple states to adopt common standards in mathematics <br>and in language arts, which has prompted interest in comparable documents for <br>science. This framework is the first part of a two-stage process to produce a next-<br>generation set of science standards for voluntary adoption by states. The second <br>step—the development of a set of standards based on this framework—is a state-<br>led effort coordinated by Achieve, Inc., involving multiple opportunities for input <br>from the states’ science educators, including teachers, and the public. <br>A VISION FOR K-12 EDUCATION IN THE SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING<br>The framework is designed to help realize a vision for education in the sciences <br>and engineering in which students, over multiple years of school, actively engage <br>in scientific and engineering practices and apply crosscutting concepts to deepen <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A New Conceptual Framework<br>9<br>their understanding of the core ideas in these fields. The learning experiences <br>provided for students should engage them with fundamental questions about the <br>world and with how scientists have investigated and found answers to those ques-<br>tions. Throughout grades K-12, students should have the opportunity to carry out <br>scientific investigations and engineering design projects related to the disciplinary <br></span><span style="background-color: #FDFFB6;" title="Chunk 18 | Start: 40299 | End: 42724 | Tokens: 504">core ideas. <br>By the end of the 12th grade, students should have gained sufficient knowl-<br>edge of the practices, crosscutting concepts, and core ideas of science and engi-<br>neering to engage in public discussions on science-related issues, to be critical <br>consumers of scientific information related to their everyday lives, and to continue <br>to learn about science throughout their lives. They should come to appreciate <br>that science and the current scientific understanding of the world are the result of <br>many hundreds of years of creative human endeavor. It is especially important to <br>note that the above goals are for all students, not just those who pursue careers in <br>science, engineering, or technology or those who continue on to higher education.<br>We anticipate that the insights gained and interests provoked from study-<br>ing and engaging in the practices of science and engineering during their K-12 <br>schooling should help students see how science and engineering are instrumental <br>in addressing major challenges that confront society today, such as generating <br>sufficient energy, preventing and treating diseases, maintaining supplies of clean <br>water and food, and solving the problems of global environmental change. In <br>addition, although not all students will choose to pursue careers in science, engi-<br>neering, or technology, we hope that a science education based on the framework <br>will motivate and inspire a greater number of people—and a better representation <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>10<br>of the broad diversity of the American population—to follow these paths than is <br>the case today.<br>The committee’s vision takes into account two major goals for K-12 science <br>education: (1) educating all students in science and engineering and (2) providing <br>the foundational knowledge for those who will become the scientists, engineers, <br>technologists, and technicians of the future. The framework principally concerns <br>itself with the first task—what all students should know in preparation for their <br>individual lives and for their roles as citizens in this technology-rich and scientifi-<br>cally complex world. Course options, including Advanced Placement (AP) or hon-<br>ors courses, should be provided that allow for greater breadth or depth in the sci-<br></span><span style="background-color: #CAFFBF;" title="Chunk 19 | Start: 42724 | End: 45012 | Tokens: 496">ence topics that students pursue, not only in the usual disciplines taught as natural <br>sciences in the K-12 context but also in allied subjects, such as psychology, com-<br>puter science, and economics. It is the committee’s conviction that such an educa-<br>tion, done well, will excite many more young people about science-related subjects <br>and generate a desire to pursue science- or engineering-based careers.<br>Achieving the Vision<br>The framework is motivated in part by a growing national consensus around the <br>need for greater coherence—that is, a sense of unity—in K-12 science education. <br>Too often, standards are long lists of detailed and disconnected facts, reinforcing <br>the criticism that science curricula in the United States tend to be “a mile wide <br>and an inch deep” [1]. Not only is such an approach alienating to young people, <br>but it can also leave them with just fragments of knowledge and little sense of the <br>creative achievements of science, its inherent logic and consistency, and its uni-<br>versality. Moreover, that approach neglects the need for students to develop an <br>understanding of the practices of science and engineering, which is as important to <br>understanding science as knowledge of its content.<br>The framework endeavors to move science education toward a more coherent <br>vision in three ways. First, it is built on the notion of learning as a developmental <br>❚ The framework is designed to help realize a vision for education in <br>the sciences and engineering in which students, over multiple years of <br>school, actively engage in scientific and engineering practices and apply <br>crosscutting concepts to deepen their understanding of the core ideas in <br>these fields. ❚<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A New Conceptual Framework<br>11<br>progression. It is designed to help children continually build on and revise their <br>knowledge and abilities, starting from their curiosity about what they see around <br>them and their initial conceptions about how the world works. The goal is to guide <br>their knowledge toward a more scientifically based and coherent view of the sci-<br>ences and engineering, as well as of the ways in which they are pursued and their <br></span><span style="background-color: #9BF6FF;" title="Chunk 20 | Start: 45012 | End: 47292 | Tokens: 498">results can be used. <br>Second, the framework focuses on a limited number of core ideas in sci-<br>ence and engineering both within and across the disciplines. The committee <br>made this choice in order to avoid shallow coverage of a large number of topics <br>and to allow more time for teachers and students to explore each idea in greater <br>depth. Reduction of the sheer sum of details to be mastered is intended to give <br>time for students to engage in scientific investigations and argumentation and to <br>achieve depth of understanding of the core ideas presented. Delimiting what is to <br>be learned about each core idea within each grade band also helps clarify what <br>is most important to spend time on and avoid the proliferation of detail to be <br>learned with no conceptual grounding.<br>Third, the framework emphasizes that learning about science and engineer-<br>ing involves integration of the knowledge of scientific explanations (i.e., content <br>knowledge) and the practices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineer-<br>ing design. Thus the framework seeks to illustrate how knowledge and practice <br>must be intertwined in designing learning experiences in K-12 science education. <br>Limitations of This Framework<br>The terms “science,” “engineering,” and “technology” are often lumped together <br>as a single phrase, both in this report and in education policy circles. But it is <br>important to define what is meant by each of these terms in this report—and why. <br>In the K-12 context, science is generally taken to mean the traditional natu-<br>ral sciences: physics, chemistry, biology, and (more recently) earth, space, and <br>environmental sciences. In this document, we include core ideas for these disciplin-<br>ary areas, but not for all areas of science, as discussed further below. This limita-<br>tion matches our charge and the need of schools for a next generation of stan-<br>dards in these areas. Engineering and technology are included as they relate to the <br>applications of science, and in so doing they offer students a path to strengthen <br>their understanding of the role of sciences. We use the term engineering in a very <br>broad sense to mean any engagement in a systematic practice of design to achieve <br>solutions to particular human problems. Likewise, we broadly use the term tech-<br></span><span style="background-color: #A0C4FF;" title="Chunk 21 | Start: 47292 | End: 49684 | Tokens: 501">nology to include all types of human-made systems and processes—not in the <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>12<br>limited sense often used in schools that equates technology with modern compu-<br>tational and communications devices. Technologies result when engineers apply <br>their understanding of the natural world and of human behavior to design ways <br>to satisfy human needs and wants. This is not to say that science necessarily pre-<br>cedes technology; throughout history, advances in scientific understanding often <br>have been driven by engineers’ questions as they work to design new or improved <br>machines or systems.<br>Engineering and technology, defined in these broad ways, are included in <br>the framework for several reasons. First, the committee thinks it is important for <br>students to explore the practical use of science, given that a singular focus on the <br>core ideas of the disciplines would tend to shortchange the importance of applica-<br>tions. Second, at least at the K-8 level, these topics typically do not appear else-<br>where in the curriculum and thus are neglected if not included in science instruc-<br>tion. Finally, engineering and technology provide a context in which students can <br>test their own developing scientific knowledge and apply it to practical problems; <br>doing so enhances their understanding of science—and, for many, their interest in <br>science—as they recognize the interplay among science, engineering, and technol-<br>ogy. We are convinced that engagement in the practices of engineering design is as <br>much a part of learning science as engagement in the practices of science [2].<br>It is important to note, however, that the framework is not intended to <br>define course structure, particularly at the high school level. Many high schools <br>already have courses designated as technology, design, or even engineering that <br>go beyond the limited introduction to these topics specified in the framework. <br>These courses are often taught by teachers who have specialized expertise and <br>do not consider themselves to be science teachers. The committee takes no posi-<br>tion on such courses—nor, in fact, on any particular set of course sequence <br>options for students at the high school level. We simply maintain that some <br></span><span style="background-color: #BDB2FF;" title="Chunk 22 | Start: 49684 | End: 52016 | Tokens: 503">introduction to engineering practice, the application of science, and the inter-<br>relationship of science, engineering, and technology is integral to the learning of <br>science for all students.<br>❚ The committee’s vision takes into account two major goals for K-12 <br>science education: (1) educating all students in science and engineering <br>and (2) providing the foundational knowledge for those who will become <br>the scientists, engineers, technologists, and technicians of the future. ❚<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A New Conceptual Framework<br>13<br>More generally, this framework should not be interpreted as limiting <br>advanced courses that go beyond the material included here—all students at the <br>high school level should have opportunities for advanced study in areas of interest <br>to them, and it is hoped that, for many, this will include further study of specific <br>science disciplines in honors or AP courses. Such course options may include top-<br>ics, such as neurobiology, and even disciplines, such as economics, that are not <br>included in this framework.<br>Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences<br>Although some aspects of the behavioral sciences are incorporated in the frame-<br>work as part of life sciences, the social, behavioral, and economic sciences are not <br>fully addressed. The committee did not identify a separate set of core ideas for <br>these fields for several reasons. <br>First, the original charge to the committee did not include these disciplines. <br>Second, social, behavioral, and economic sciences include a diverse array of fields <br>(sociology, economics, political science, anthropology, all of the branches of psy-<br>chology) with different methods, theories, relationships to other disciplines of <br>science, and representation in the K-12 curriculum. Although some are currently <br>represented in grades K-12, many are not or appear only in courses offered at the <br>high school level. <br>Third, the committee based the framework on existing documents that out-<br>line the major ideas for K-12 science education, including the National Science <br>Education Standards (NSES) [3], the Benchmarks for Science Literacy [4] and the <br>accompanying Atlas [5], the Science Framework for the 2009 National Assessment <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFC6FF;" title="Chunk 23 | Start: 52016 | End: 54374 | Tokens: 497">of Educational Progress (NAEP) [6], and the Science College Board Standards for <br>College Success [7]. Most of these documents do not cover all of the fields that are <br>part of the social, behavioral, and economic sciences comprehensively, and some <br>omit them entirely. <br>Fourth, understanding how to integrate the social, behavioral, and economic <br>sciences into standards, given how subjects are currently organized in the K-12 <br>system, is especially complex. These fields have typically not been included as part <br>of the science curriculum and, as noted above, are not represented systematically <br>in some of the major national-level documents that identify core concepts for K-12 <br>science. Also, many of the topics related to the social, behavioral, and economic <br>sciences are incorporated into curricula or courses identified as social studies and <br>may be taught from a humanities perspective. In fact, the National Council for the <br>Social Studies has a set of National Curriculum Standards for Social Studies that <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>14<br>includes standards in such areas as psychology, sociology, geography, anthropol-<br>ogy, political science, and economics [8]. <br>The limited treatment of these fields in this report’s framework should not, <br>however, be interpreted to mean that the social, behavioral, and economic sci-<br>ences should be omitted from the K-12 curriculum. On the contrary, the commit-<br>tee strongly believes that these important disciplines need their own framework <br>for defining core concepts to be learned at the K-12 level and that learning (the <br>development of understanding of content and practices) in the physical, life, earth, <br>and space sciences and engineering should be strongly linked with parallel learning <br>in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences. Any such framework must also <br>address important and challenging issues of school and curriculum organization <br>around the domain of social sciences and social studies. <br>Our committee has neither the charge nor the expertise to undertake that <br>important work. Thus, although we have included references to some of the <br>social, behavioral, and economic issues connected to the sciences that are the focus <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFADAD;" title="Chunk 24 | Start: 54374 | End: 56656 | Tokens: 499">of our own framework (see, for example, Core Idea 2 in engineering, technol-<br>ogy, and applications of science), we do not consider these references to define <br>the entirety of what students should learn or discuss about social, behavioral, and <br>economic sciences. <br>In a separate effort, the National Research Council (NRC) has plans to con-<br>vene a workshop to begin exploring a definition of what core ideas in the social, <br>behavioral, and economic sciences would be appropriate to teach at the K-12 level <br>and at what grade levels to introduce them. As noted above, there are many quite <br>distinct realms of study covered by the terms. Given the multiplicity and variety <br>of disciplines involved, only a few of which are currently addressed in any way in <br>K-12 classrooms, there is much work to be done to address the role of these sci-<br>ences in the development of an informed 21st-century citizen. It is clear, however, <br>to the authors of this report that these sciences, although different in focus, do <br>have much in common with the subject areas included here, so that much of what <br>this report discusses in defining scientific and engineering practices and crosscut-<br>ting concepts has application across this broader realm of science. <br>Computer Science and Statistics<br>Computer science and statistics are other areas of science that are not addressed <br>here, even though they have a valid presence in K-12 education. Statistics is basi-<br>cally a subdiscipline of mathematical sciences, and it is addressed to some extent <br>in the common core mathematics standards. Computer science, too, can be seen <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A New Conceptual Framework<br>15<br>as a branch of the mathematical sciences, as well as having some elements of engi-<br>neering. But, again, because this area of the curriculum has a history and a teach-<br>ing corps that are generally distinct from those of the sciences, the committee has <br>not taken this domain as part of our charge. Once again, this omission should not <br>be interpreted to mean that computer science or statistics should be excluded from <br>the K-12 curriculum. There are aspects of computational and statistical thinking <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFD6A5;" title="Chunk 25 | Start: 56656 | End: 59062 | Tokens: 506">that must be understood and applied in learning about the sciences, and we iden-<br>tify these aspects, along with mathematical thinking, in our discussion of science <br>practices in Chapter 3. <br>ABOUT THIS REPORT<br>The Committee on a Conceptual Framework for New K-12 Science Education <br>Standards was established by the NRC to undertake the study on which this <br>report is based. Composed of 18 members reflecting a diversity of perspectives <br>and a broad range of expertise, the committee includes professionals in the natural <br>sciences, mathematics, engineering, cognitive and developmental psychology, the <br>learning sciences, education policy and implementation, research on learning sci-<br>ence in the classroom, and the practice of teaching science. <br>The committee’s charge was to develop a conceptual framework that <br>would specify core ideas in the life sciences, physical sciences, earth and space <br>sciences, and engineering and technology, as well as crosscutting concepts and <br>practices, around which standards should be developed. The committee was also <br>charged with articulating how these disciplinary ideas and crosscutting concepts <br>intersect for at least three grade levels and to develop guidance for implementa-<br>tion (see Box 1-1).<br>Scope and Approach<br>The committee carried out the charge through an iterative process of amassing <br>information, deliberating on it, identifying gaps, gathering further information to <br>fill these gaps, and holding further discussions. In our search for particulars, we <br>held three public fact-finding meetings, reviewed published reports and unpub-<br>lished research, and commissioned experts to prepare and present papers. At our <br>fourth meeting, we deliberated on the form and structure of the framework and <br>on the content of the report’s supporting chapters, to prepare a draft framework <br>for public release in July 2010. During the fifth and sixth meetings, we considered <br>the feedback received from the public and developed a plan for revising the draft <br>framework based on this input (see below for further details).<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

In conducting the study and preparing its report, the committee will draw on current research on sci-<br>ence learning as well as research and evaluation evidence related to standards-based education reform. This will <br>include existing efforts to specify central ideas for science education, including the National Science Education <br>Standards, AAAS Benchmarks, the 2009 NAEP Framework, and the redesign of the AP courses by the College <br>Board.<br>The conceptual framework developed by the committee will identify and articulate the core ideas in science <br>around which standards should be developed by considering core ideas in the disciplines of science (life sciences, <br>physical sciences, earth and space sciences, and applied sciences) as well as crosscutting ideas such as mathema-<br>tization,* causal reasoning, evaluating and using evidence, argumentation, and model development. The com-<br>mittee will illustrate with concrete examples how crosscutting ideas may play out in the context of select core <br>disciplinary ideas and articulate expectations for students’ learning of these ideas for at least three key grade <br>levels. In parallel, the committee will develop a research and development plan to inform future revisions of the <br>standards.

Each team had a designated <br>leader who provided guidance and interacted frequently with the committee. The <br>materials developed by the teams form the foundation for the core disciplinary <br>ideas and grade band endpoints described in this report (Chapters 5-8). A list of <br>the design team participants appears in Appendix D.<br>The design teams were asked to begin their work by considering the <br>ideas and practices described in the NSES [3], AAAS Benchmarks [4], Science <br>Framework for the 2009 NAEP [6], and Science College Board Standards for <br>College Success [7] as well as the relevant research on learning and teaching in <br>science. The teams prepared drafts and presented them to the committee dur-<br>ing the closed portions of our first three meetings. Between meetings, the teams <br>revised their drafts in response to committee comments. Following the release <br>of the July 2010 draft (see the next section), the leaders of the design teams <br>continued to interact with committee members as they planned the revisions of <br>the draft framework.

All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>18<br>Public Feedback<br>The committee recognized early in the process that obtaining feedback from a <br>broad range of stakeholders and experts would be crucial to the success of the <br>framework. For this reason, we obtained permission from the NRC to release a <br>draft version of the framework for public comment. <br>The draft version was prepared, underwent an expedited NRC review, and <br>was released in early July 2010. It was then posted online for a period of three <br>weeks, during which time individuals could submit comments through an online <br>survey. In addition, NRC staff contacted over 40 organizations in science, engi-<br>neering, and education, notifying them of the public comment period and asking <br>them to hold focus groups to gather feedback from members or to at least notify <br>their members of the opportunity to comment online. The NRC also worked <br>closely with the National Science Teachers Association, the American Association <br>for the Advancement of Science, Achieve, Inc., and the Council of State Science <br>Supervisors both to facilitate the public input process and to organize focus <br>groups. Finally, the committee asked nine experts to provide detailed feedback on <br>the public draft.<br>During the 3-week public comment period, the committee received exten-<br>sive input from both individuals and groups: a total of more than 2,000 people <br>responded to the online survey. More than 30 focus groups were held around the <br>country, with 15-40 participants in each group. The committee also received let-<br>ters from key individuals and organizations. A list of the organizations that par-<br>ticipated in the focus groups or submitted letters is included in Appendix A. <br>NRC staff, together with the committee chair, reviewed all of the input and <br>developed summaries that identified the major issues raised and outlined possible <br>revisions to the draft framework. Committee members reviewed these summaries <br>and also had the opportunity to review the public feedback in detail.

All rights reserved.<br>A New Conceptual Framework<br>19<br>The remaining four chapters of the report address issues related to design-<br>ing and implementing standards and strengthening the research base that should <br>inform them. Chapter 10 articulates the issues related to curriculum, instruction, <br>and assessment. Chapter 11 discusses important considerations related to equity <br>and diversity. Chapter 12 provides guidance for standards developers as they work <br>to apply the framework. Finally, Chapter 13 outlines the research agenda that <br>would allow a systematic implementation of the framework and related standards. <br>The chapter also specifies the kinds of research needed for future iterations of the <br>standards to be better grounded in evidence. <br>NEXT STEPS<br>The National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School <br>Officers have developed “Common Core State Standards” in mathematics and <br>language arts, and 43 states and the District of Columbia have adopted these stan-<br>dards as of early 2011. The anticipation of a similar effort for science standards <br>was a prime motivator for this NRC study and the resulting framework described <br>in this report. <br>To maintain the momentum, the Carnegie Corporation commissioned the <br>nonpartisan and nonprofit educational reform organization Achieve, Inc., to lead <br>states in developing new science standards based on the NRC framework in this <br>report. There is no prior commitment from multiple states to adopt such stan-<br>dards, so the process will be different from the Common Core process used for <br>mathematics and language arts. But it is expected that Achieve will form partner-<br>ships with a number of states in undertaking this work and will offer multiple <br>opportunities for public comment. <br>As our report was being completed, Achieve’s work on science standards <br></span><span style="background-color: #BDB2FF;" title="Chunk 30 | Start: 68675 | End: 70829 | Tokens: 493">was already under way, starting with an analysis of international science bench-<br>marking in high-performing countries that is expected to inform the standards <br>development process. We understand that Achieve has also begun some prelimi-<br>nary planning for that process based on the draft framework that was circulated <br>for public comment in summer 2010. The relevance of such work should deepen <br>once the revised framework in this report, on which Achieve’s standards will be <br>based, is released. It should be noted, however, that our study and the framework <br>described in this report are independent of the work of Achieve. <br>The framework and any standards that will be based on it make explicit the <br>goals around which a science education system should be organized [9].

Much of this <br>research base has been synthesized in other National Research Council <br>(NRC) reports. Research on how children learn science and the implications for <br>science instruction in grades K-8 was central to Taking Science to School [1], <br>America’s Lab Report [2] examined the role of laboratory experiences in high <br>school science instruction, and Learning Science in Informal Environments [3] <br>focused on the role of science learning experiences outside school. Complementing <br>these publications, Systems for State Science Assessment [4] studied large-scale <br>assessments of science learning, and Engineering in K-12 Education [5] looked <br>into the knowledge and skills needed to introduce students to engineering in <br>grades K-12. All of these NRC reports have been essential input to the develop-<br>ment of the framework. <br>The framework also builds on two other prior works on standards: <br>Benchmarks for Science Literacy published by the American Association for the <br>Advancement of Science (AAAS) [6] and the NRC’s National Science Education <br>Standards (NSES) [7]. In addition, the committee examined more recent efforts, <br>including the Science Framework for the 2009 National Assessment of Educational <br>Progress [8], Science College Board Standards for College Success [9], the National <br>Science Teachers Association’s (NSTA’s) Science Anchors project [10], and a variety <br>of state and international science standards and curriculum specifications.<br></span><span style="background-color: #FFD6A5;" title="Chunk 33 | Start: 74747 | End: 76943 | Tokens: 508">GUIDING ASSUMPTIONS AND <br>ORGANIZATION OF THE FRAMEWORK<br>2<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>24<br>PRINCIPLES OF THE FRAMEWORK<br>Several guiding principles, drawn from what is known about the nature of learn-<br>ing science, underlie both the structure and the content of the framework. These <br>principles include young children’s capacity to learn science, a focus on core <br>ideas, the development of true understanding over time, the consideration both of <br>knowledge and practice, the linkage of science education to students’ interests and <br>experiences, and the promotion of equity. <br>Children Are Born Investigators<br>The research summarized in Taking Science to School [1] revealed that children <br>entering kindergarten have surprisingly sophisticated ways of thinking about the <br>world, based in part on their direct experiences with the physical environment, <br>such as watching objects fall or <br>collide and observing plants and <br>animals [11-16]. They also learn <br>about the world through everyday <br>activities, such as talking with their <br>families, pursuing hobbies, watching <br>television, and playing with friends <br>[3]. As children try to understand <br>and influence the world around <br>them, they develop ideas about <br>their role in that world and how it <br>works [17-19]. In fact, the capacity <br>of young children—from all back-<br>grounds and socioeconomic levels—<br>to reason in sophisticated ways is <br>much greater than has long been <br>assumed [1]. Although they may <br>lack deep knowledge and extensive <br>experience, they often engage in a <br>wide range of subtle and complex <br>reasoning about the world [20-23]. <br>Thus, before they even enter school, children have developed their own ideas about <br>the physical, biological, and social worlds and how they work. By listening to and <br>taking these ideas seriously, educators can build on what children already know <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>Guiding Assumptions and Organization of the Framework<br></span><span style="background-color: #FDFFB6;" title="Chunk 34 | Start: 76943 | End: 79307 | Tokens: 495">25<br>and can do. Such initial ideas may be more or less cohesive and sometimes may be <br>incorrect. However, some of children’s early intuitions about the world can be used <br>as a foundation to build remarkable understanding, even in the earliest grades. <br>Indeed, both building on and refining prior conceptions (which can include miscon-<br>ceptions) are important in teaching science at any grade level. The implication of <br>these findings for the framework is that building progressively more sophisticated <br>explanations of natural phenomena is central throughout grades K-5, as opposed <br>to focusing only on description in the early grades and leaving explanation to the <br>later grades. Similarly, students can engage in scientific and engineering practices <br>beginning in the early grades.<br>Focusing on Core Ideas and Practices<br>The framework focuses on a limited set of core ideas in order to avoid the cover-<br>age of multiple disconnected topics—the oft-mentioned mile wide and inch deep. <br>This focus allows for deep exploration of important concepts, as well as time for <br>students to develop meaningful understanding, to actually practice science and <br>engineering, and to reflect on their nature. It also results in a science education <br>that extends in a more coherent way across grades K-12. <br>The core ideas also can provide an organizational structure for the acquisi-<br>tion of new knowledge. Understanding the core ideas and engaging in the scien-<br>tific and engineering practices helps to prepare students for broader understand-<br>ing, and deeper levels of scientific and engineering investigation, later on—in high <br>school, college, and beyond. One rationale for organizing content around core <br>ideas comes from studies comparing experts and novices in any field. Experts <br>understand the core principles and theoretical constructs of their field, and they <br>use them to make sense of new information or tackle novel problems. Novices, in <br>contrast, tend to hold disconnected and even contradictory bits of knowledge as <br>isolated facts and struggle to find a way to organize and integrate them [24]. The <br>assumption, then, is that helping students learn the core ideas through engaging <br>in scientific and engineering practices will enable them to become less like novices <br>and more like experts. <br>Importantly, this approach will also help students build the capacity to <br></span><span style="background-color: #CAFFBF;" title="Chunk 35 | Start: 79307 | End: 81762 | Tokens: 506">develop more flexible and coherent—that is, wide-ranging—understanding of sci-<br>ence. Research on learning shows that supporting development of this kind of <br>understanding is challenging, but it is aided by explicit instructional support that <br>stresses connections across different activities and learning experiences. <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>26<br>Understanding Develops Over Time<br>To develop a thorough understanding of scientific explanations of the world, <br>students need sustained opportunities to work with and develop the underlying <br>ideas and to appreciate those ideas’ interconnections over a period of years rather <br>than weeks or months [1]. This sense of development has been conceptualized in <br>the idea of learning progressions [1, 25, 26]. If mastery of a core idea in a science <br>discipline is the ultimate educational destination, then well-designed learning pro-<br>gressions provide a map of the routes that can be taken to reach that destination. <br>Such progressions describe both how students’ understanding of the idea matures <br>over time and the instructional supports and experiences that are needed for them <br>to make progress. Learning progressions may extend all the way from preschool <br>to 12th grade and beyond—indeed, people can continue learning about scientific <br>core ideas their entire lives. Because learning progressions extend over multiple <br>years, they can prompt educators to consider how topics are presented at each <br>grade level so that they build on prior understanding and can support increasingly <br>sophisticated learning. Hence, core ideas and their related learning progressions <br>are key organizing principles for the design of the framework. <br>Science and Engineering Require Both Knowledge and Practice<br>Science is not just a body of knowledge that reflects current understanding of the <br>world; it is also a set of practices used to establish, extend, and refine that knowl-<br>edge. Both elements—knowledge and practice—are essential. <br>In science, knowledge, based on evidence from many investigations, is inte-<br>grated into highly developed and well-tested theories that can explain bodies of <br>data and predict outcomes of further investigations. Although the practices used <br>to develop scientific theories (as well as the form that those theories take) differ <br></span><span style="background-color: #9BF6FF;" title="Chunk 36 | Start: 81762 | End: 84202 | Tokens: 509">from one domain of science to another, all sciences share certain common fea-<br>tures at the core of their inquiry-based and problem-solving approaches. Chief <br>among these features is a commitment to data and evidence as the foundation <br>❚ Building progressively more sophisticated explanations of natural <br>phenomena is central throughout grades K-5, as opposed to focusing <br>only on description in the early grades and leaving explanation to the <br>later grades. ❚<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>Guiding Assumptions and Organization of the Framework<br>27<br>for developing claims. The argumentation and analysis that relate evidence and <br>theory are also essential features of science; scientists need to be able to examine, <br>review, and evaluate their own knowledge and ideas and critique those of others. <br>Argumentation and analysis include appraisal of data quality, modeling of theo-<br>ries, development of new testable questions from those models, and modification <br>of theories and models as evidence indicates they are needed. <br>Finally, science is fundamentally a social enterprise, and scientific knowl-<br>edge advances through collaboration and in the context of a social system with <br>well-developed norms. Individual scientists may do much of their work indepen-<br>dently or they may collaborate closely with colleagues. Thus, new ideas can be the <br>product of one mind or many working together. However, the theories, models, <br>instruments, and methods for collecting and displaying data, as well as the norms <br>for building arguments from evidence, are developed collectively in a vast net-<br>work of scientists working together over extended periods. As they carry out their <br>research, scientists talk frequently with their colleagues, both formally and infor-<br>mally. They exchange emails, engage in discussions at conferences, share research <br>techniques and analytical procedures, and present and respond to ideas via pub-<br>lication in journals and books. In short, scientists constitute a community whose <br>members work together to build a body of evidence and devise and test theories. <br>In addition, this community and its culture exist in the larger social and economic <br>context of their place and time and are influenced by events, needs, and norms <br>from outside science, as well as by the interests and desires of scientists.<br></span><span style="background-color: #A0C4FF;" title="Chunk 37 | Start: 84202 | End: 86526 | Tokens: 501">Similarly, engineering involves both knowledge and a set of practices. <br>The major goal of engineering is to solve problems that arise from a specific <br>human need or desire. To do this, engineers rely on their knowledge of science <br>and mathematics as well as their understanding of the engineering design pro-<br>cess. Defining and solving the problem, that is, specifying what is needed and <br>designing a solution for it, are the parts of engineering on which we focus in this <br>framework, both because they provide students a place to practice the appli-<br>cation of their understanding of science and because the design process is an <br>important way for K-12 students to develop an understanding of engineering as <br>❚ Science is not just a body of knowledge that reflects current <br>understanding of the world; it is also a set of practices used to establish, <br>extend, and refine that knowledge. ❚<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

The work of engineers, like the work <br>of scientists, involves both individual and cooperative effort; and it requires spe-<br>cialized knowledge. Hence, we include both engineering practices and engineer-<br>ing core ideas in this framework.<br>Connecting to Students’ Interests and Experiences<br>A rich science education has the potential to capture students’ sense of wonder <br>about the world and to spark their desire to continue learning about science <br>throughout their lives. Research suggests that personal interest, experience, and <br>enthusiasm—critical to children’s learning of science at school or in other set-<br>tings—may also be linked to later educational and career choices [27-30]. Thus, <br>in order for students to develop a sustained attraction to science and for them <br>to appreciate the many ways in which it is pertinent to their daily lives, class-<br>room learning experiences in science need to connect with their own interests <br>and experiences. <br>As a strategy for building on prior interest, the disciplinary core ideas identi-<br>fied here are described not only with an eye toward the knowledge that students <br>bring with them to school but also toward the kinds of questions they are likely to <br></span><span style="background-color: #BDB2FF;" title="Chunk 38 | Start: 86526 | End: 88757 | Tokens: 494">pose themselves at different ages. Such questions as “Where do we come from?,” <br>“Why is the sky blue?,” and “What is the smallest piece of matter?” are funda-<br>mental hooks that engage young people. Framing a curriculum around such sets of <br>questions helps to communicate relevance and salience to this audience.<br>Promoting Equity<br>Equity in science education requires that all students are provided with equitable <br>opportunities to learn science and become engaged in science and engineering <br>practices; with access to quality space, equipment, and teachers to support and <br>motivate that learning and engagement; and adequate time spent on science. In <br>addition, the issue of connecting to students’ interests and experiences is particu-<br>larly important for broadening participation in science. There is increasing recog-<br>nition that the diverse customs and orientations that members of different cultural <br>communities bring both to formal and to informal science learning contexts are <br>assets on which to build—both for the benefit of the student and ultimately of sci-<br>ence itself. For example, researchers have documented that children reared in rural <br>agricultural communities, who experience intense and regular interactions with <br>plants and animals, develop more sophisticated understanding of ecology and bio-<br>logical species than do urban and suburban children of the same age [31-33].<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Not only should all <br>students be expected to attain these standards, but also work is needed to ensure <br>that all are provided with high-quality opportunities to engage in significant sci-<br>ence and engineering learning.<br>STRUCTURE OF THE FRAMEWORK<br>Based on the guiding principles outlined above, we have created a framework—<br>comprised of three dimensions—that broadly outlines the knowledge and prac-<br>tices of the sciences and engineering that all students should learn by the end of <br>high school: <br>•	<br>Dimension 1 describes scientific and engineering practices. <br>•	<br>Dimension 2 describes crosscutting concepts—that is, those having applica-<br>bility across science disciplines.<br>•	<br>Dimension 3 describes core ideas in the science disciplines and of the rela-<br>tionships among science, engineering, and technology. <br>The three dimensions of the framework, which constitute the major con-<br>clusions of this report, are presented in separate chapters. However, in order to <br>facilitate students’ learning, the dimensions must be woven together in standards, <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>30<br>curricula, instruction, and assessments. When they explore particular disciplinary <br>ideas from Dimension 3, students will do so by engaging in practices articulated in <br>Dimension 1 and should be helped to make connections to the crosscutting con-<br>cepts in Dimension 2. <br>Dimension 1: Practices<br>Dimension 1 describes (a) the major practices that scientists employ as they inves-<br>tigate and build models and theories about the world and (b) a key set of engi-<br>neering practices that engineers use as they design and build systems. We use the <br>term “practices” instead of a term such as “skills” to emphasize that engaging in <br>scientific investigation requires not only skill but also knowledge that is specific to <br>each practice. <br>Similarly, because the term “inquiry,” extensively referred to in previous <br>standards documents, has been interpreted over time in many different ways <br>throughout the science education community, part of our intent in articulating <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFADAD;" title="Chunk 40 | Start: 91020 | End: 93394 | Tokens: 496">the practices in Dimension 1 is to better specify what is meant by inquiry in sci-<br>ence and the range of cognitive, social, and physical practices that it requires. <br>As in all inquiry-based approaches to science teaching, our expectation is that <br>students will themselves engage in the practices and not merely learn about them <br>secondhand. Students cannot comprehend scientific practices, nor fully appreci-<br>ate the nature of scientific knowledge itself, without directly experiencing those <br>practices for themselves.<br>Dimension 2: Crosscutting Concepts<br>The crosscutting concepts have application across all domains of science. As such, <br>they provide one way of linking across the domains in Dimension 3. These cross-<br>cutting concepts are not unique to this report. They echo many of the unifying <br>concepts and processes in the National Science Education Standards [7], the com-<br>mon themes in the Benchmarks for Science Literacy [6], and the unifying concepts <br>in the Science College Board Standards for College Success [9]. The framework’s <br>structure also reflects discussions related to the NSTA Science Anchors project, <br>which emphasized the need to consider not only disciplinary content but also the <br>ideas and practices that cut across the science disciplines.<br>Dimension 3: Disciplinary Core Ideas<br>The continuing expansion of scientific knowledge makes it impossible to teach all <br>the ideas related to a given discipline in exhaustive detail during the K-12 years. <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>Guiding Assumptions and Organization of the Framework<br>31<br>But given the cornucopia of information available today virtually at a touch—<br>people live, after all, in an information age—an important role of science educa-<br>tion is not to teach “all the facts” but rather to prepare students with sufficient <br>core knowledge so that they can later acquire additional information on their <br>own. An education focused on a limited set of ideas and practices in science and <br>engineering should enable students to evaluate and select reliable sources of scien-<br>tific information and allow them to continue their development well beyond their <br>K-12 school years as science learners, users of scientific knowledge, and perhaps <br>also as producers of such knowledge. <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFD6A5;" title="Chunk 41 | Start: 93394 | End: 95670 | Tokens: 499">With these ends in mind, the committee developed its small set of core ideas <br>in science and engineering by applying the criteria listed below. Although not <br>every core idea will satisfy every one of the criteria, to be regarded as core, each <br>idea must meet at least two of them (though preferably three or all four). <br>Specifically, a core idea for K-12 science instruction should<br>1.	 Have broad importance across multiple sciences or engineering disci-<br>plines or be a key organizing principle of a single discipline.<br>2.	 Provide a key tool for understanding or investigating more complex ideas <br>and solving problems.<br>3.	 Relate to the interests and life experiences of students or be connected <br>to societal or personal concerns that require scientific or technological <br>knowledge. <br>4.	 Be teachable and learnable over multiple grades at increasing levels of <br>depth and sophistication. That is, the idea can be made accessible to <br>younger students but is broad enough to sustain continued investigation <br>over years. <br>In organizing Dimension 3, we grouped disciplinary ideas into four major <br>domains: the physical sciences; the life sciences; the earth and space sciences; <br>and engineering, technology, and applications of science. At the same time, true <br>to Dimension 2, we acknowledge the multiple connections among domains. <br>Indeed, more and more frequently, scientists work in interdisciplinary teams that <br>blur traditional boundaries. As a consequence, in some instances core ideas, or <br>elements of core ideas, appear in several disciplines (e.g., energy, human impact <br>on the planet). <br>Each core idea and its components are introduced with a question designed <br>to show some aspect of the world that this idea helps to explain. The question <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Just as new science enables or sometimes <br>demands new technologies, new technologies <br>enable new scientific investigations, allowing <br>scientists to probe realms and handle quanti-<br>ties of data previously inaccessible to them. <br>Moreover, the line between applied sci-<br>ence and engineering is fuzzy. It is impossible <br>to do engineering today without applying <br>science in the process, and, in many areas of <br>science, designing and building new experi-<br>ments requires scientists to engage in some <br>engineering practices. This interplay of sci-<br>ence and engineering makes it appropriate to <br>place engineering and technology as part of <br>the science framework at the K-12 level. In <br>this way, students can better see how science and engineering pertain to real-world <br>problems and explore opportunities to apply their scientific knowledge to engi-<br>neering design problems once this linkage is made. <br>Finally, our effort to identify a small number of core ideas may disappoint <br>some scientists and educators who find little or nothing of their favorite science <br>topics included in the framework.

For the practices and cross-<br>cutting concepts, the committee developed sketches of the possible progression for <br>each practice or concept. These progressions do not specify grade bands because <br>there was not enough available evidence to do so.<br>For the disciplinary core ideas, we provide a set of grade band endpoints <br>for each component idea that describe the developing understanding that stu-<br>dents should have acquired by the ends of grades 2, 5, 8, and 12, respectively. <br>These endpoints indicate how this idea should be developed across the span <br>of the K-12 years. In standards, curriculum, and instruction, a more complete <br>sequence that integrates the core ideas with the practices and crosscutting con-<br>cepts will be needed.<br>When possible, the grade band endpoints were informed by research on <br>teaching and learning, particularly on learning progressions (see Appendix B for <br>a list of the references the committee consulted). The committee referred to this <br>literature to help determine students’ capabilities at a particular grade band given <br>appropriate instructional support as well as potential difficulties. However, the <br>availability of such research is uneven across the core and component ideas of <br>Dimension 3.

When microscopic entities are introduced, no stress is placed on <br>understanding their size—just that they are too small to see directly. However, pic-<br>tures, physical models, and simulations can represent the entities and relate them <br>to phenomena that the students can investigate and interpret. In grades 6-8, we <br>move to atomic-level explanations of physical phenomena and cellular-level expla-<br>nations of life processes and biological structures, but without detail on the inner <br>workings of an atom or a cell. Finally, in grades 9-12 we shift to subatomic and <br>subcellular explanations. A similar progression of scales and abstraction of mod-<br>els applies in addressing phenomena of large scales and deep time. We have also <br>included some “boundary statements” that specify the level of detail students are <br>expected to know, but standards will need to further delineate such boundaries.<br>The progression for practices across the grades follows a similar pattern, <br>with grades K-2 stressing observations and explanations related to direct experi-<br>ences, grades 3-5 introducing simple models that help explain observable phenom-<br>ena, and a transition to more abstract and more detailed models and explanations <br>across the grades 6-8 and 9-12. The idea behind these choices is not that young <br>children cannot reason abstractly or imagine unseen things but that their capacity <br>to do so in a scientific context needs to be developed with opportunities presented <br>over time. There is ample opportunity to develop scientific thinking, argumenta-<br>tion, and reasoning in the context of familiar phenomena in grades K-2, and that <br>is the experience that will best support science learning across the grades. <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

There has always been a tension, however, between the emphasis <br>that should be placed on developing knowledge of the content of science and <br>the emphasis placed on scientific practices. A narrow focus on content alone has <br>the unfortunate consequence of leaving students with naive conceptions of the <br>nature of scientific inquiry [3] and the impression that science is simply a body <br>of isolated facts [4]. <br>This chapter stresses the importance of developing students’ knowledge of <br>how science and engineering achieve their ends while also strengthening their com-<br>petency with related practices. As previously noted, we use the term “practices,” <br>instead of a term such as “skills,” to stress that engaging in scientific inquiry <br>requires coordination both of knowledge and skill simultaneously. <br>In the chapter’s three major sections, we first articulate why the learning of <br>science and engineering practices is important for K-12 students and why these <br>practices should reflect those of professional scientists and engineers. Second, we <br>describe in detail eight practices we consider essential for learning science and <br>engineering in grades K-12 (see Box 3-1). Finally, we conclude that acquiring skills <br>in these practices supports a better understanding of how scientific knowledge is <br>produced and how engineering solutions are developed. Such understanding will <br>help students become more critical consumers of scientific information.<br>Dimension 1<br>SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING PRACTICES<br>3<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Students <br>may then recognize that science and engineering can contribute to meeting many <br>of the major challenges that confront society today, such as generating sufficient <br>energy, preventing and treating disease, maintaining supplies of fresh water and <br>food, and addressing climate change. Any education that focuses predominantly <br>on the detailed products of scientific labor—the facts of science—without develop-<br>ing an understanding of how those facts were established or that ignores the many <br>important applications of science in the world misrepresents science and marginal-<br>izes the importance of engineering.<br>Understanding How Scientists Work<br>The idea of science as a set of practices has emerged from the work of historians, <br></span><span style="background-color: #9BF6FF;" title="Chunk 52 | Start: 115643 | End: 117939 | Tokens: 501">philosophers, psychologists, and sociologists over the past 60 years. This work <br>illuminates how science is actually done, both in the short term (e.g., studies of <br>activity in a particular laboratory or program) and historically (studies of labora-<br>tory notebooks, published texts, eyewitness accounts) [7-9]. Seeing science as a <br>set of practices shows that theory development, reasoning, and testing are compo-<br>nents of a larger ensemble of activities that includes networks of participants and <br>institutions [10, 11], specialized ways of talking and writing [12], the development <br>of models to represent systems or phenomena [13-15], the making of predictive <br>inferences, construction of appropriate instrumentation, and testing of hypotheses <br>by experiment or observation [16]. <br>Our view is that this perspective is an improvement over previous <br>approaches in several ways. First, it minimizes the tendency to reduce scientific <br>practice to a single set of procedures, such as identifying and controlling variables, <br>classifying entities, and identifying sources of error. This tendency overemphasizes <br>experimental investigation at the expense of other practices, such as modeling, <br>critique, and communication. In addition, when such procedures are taught in iso-<br>lation from science content, they become the aims of instruction in and of them-<br>selves rather than a means of developing a deeper understanding of the concepts <br>and purposes of science [17]. <br>❚ The actual doing of science or engineering can pique students’ <br>curiosity, capture their interest, and motivate their continued study. ❚<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>44<br>Second, a focus on practices (in the plural) avoids the mistaken impression <br>that there is one distinctive approach common to all science—a single “scientific <br>method”—or that uncertainty is a universal attribute of science. In reality, practicing <br>scientists employ a broad spectrum of methods, and although science involves many <br>areas of uncertainty as knowledge is developed, there are now many aspects of sci-<br>entific knowledge that are so well established as to be unquestioned foundations of <br></span><span style="background-color: #A0C4FF;" title="Chunk 53 | Start: 117939 | End: 120349 | Tokens: 506">the culture and its technologies. It is only through engagement in the practices that <br>students can recognize how such knowledge comes about and why some parts of <br>scientific theory are more firmly established than others.<br>Third, attempts to develop the idea that science should be taught through <br>a process of inquiry have been hampered by the lack of a commonly accepted <br>definition of its constituent elements. Such ambiguity results in widely divergent <br>pedagogic objectives [18]—an outcome that is counterproductive to the goal of <br>common standards. <br>The focus here is on important practices, such as modeling, developing <br>explanations, and engaging in critique and evaluation (argumentation), that have <br>too often been underemphasized in the context of science education. In particular, <br>we stress that critique is an essential element both for building new knowledge <br>in general and for the learning of science in particular [19, 20]. Traditionally, <br>K-12 science education has paid little attention to the role of critique in science. <br>However, as all ideas in science are evaluated against alternative explanations and <br>compared with evidence, acceptance of an explanation is ultimately an assess-<br>ment of what data are reliable and relevant and a decision about which explana-<br>tion is the most satisfactory. Thus knowing why the wrong answer is wrong can <br>help secure a deeper and stronger understanding of why the right answer is right. <br>Engaging in argumentation from evidence about an explanation supports students’ <br>understanding of the reasons and empirical evidence for that explanation, demon-<br>strating that science is a body of knowledge rooted in evidence.<br>How the Practices Are Integrated into Both Inquiry and Design<br>One helpful way of understanding the practices of scientists and engineers is to <br>frame them as work that is done in three spheres of activity, as shown in Figure <br>3-1. In one sphere, the dominant activity is investigation and empirical inquiry. <br>In the second, the essence of work is the construction of explanations or designs <br>using reasoning, creative thinking, and models. And in the third sphere, the ideas, <br>such as the fit of models and explanations to evidence or the appropriateness of <br>product designs, are analyzed, debated, and evaluated [21-23]. In all three spheres <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br></span><span style="background-color: #BDB2FF;" title="Chunk 54 | Start: 120349 | End: 122627 | Tokens: 500">Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

In <br>this sphere of activity, scientists determine what needs to be measured; observe <br>phenomena; plan experiments, programs of observation, and methods of data <br>collection; build instruments; engage in disciplined fieldwork; and identify sourc-<br>es of uncertainty. For their part, engineers engage in testing that will contribute <br>data for informing proposed designs. A civil engineer, for example, cannot design <br>a new highway without measuring the terrain and collecting data about the <br>nature of the soil and water flows. <br>The activities related to developing explanations and solutions are shown <br>at the right of the figure. For scientists, their work in this sphere of activity is to <br>draw from established theories and models and to propose extensions to theory <br>or create new models. Often, they develop a model or hypothesis that leads to <br>new questions to investigate or alternative explanations to consider. For engineers, <br>the major practice is the production of designs. Design development also involves <br>constructing models, for example, computer simulations of new structures or pro-<br>cesses that may be used to test a design under a range of simulated conditions or, <br>THE REAL WORLD<br>COLLECT DATA<br>TEST SOLUTIONS<br>THEORIES<br>AND MODELS<br>FORMULATE HYPOTHESES<br>PROPOSE SOLUTIONS<br>Ask Questions<br>Observe<br>Experiment<br>Measure<br>Imagine<br>Reason<br>Calculate<br>Predict<br>ARGUE<br>CRITIQUE<br>ANALYZE<br>Investigating<br>Developing Explanations<br>and Solutions<br>Evaluating<br>FIGURE 3-1 The three spheres of activity for scientists and engineers.<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Both scientists and engineers use their <br>models—including sketches, diagrams, mathematical relationships, simulations, <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFC6FF;" title="Chunk 55 | Start: 122627 | End: 125036 | Tokens: 505">and physical models—to make predictions about the likely behavior of a system, <br>and they then collect data to evaluate the predictions and possibly revise the mod-<br>els as a result. <br>Between and within these two spheres of activity is the practice of evalua-<br>tion, represented by the middle space. Here is an iterative process that repeats at <br>every step of the work. Critical thinking is required, whether in developing and <br>refining an idea (an explanation or a design) or in conducting an investigation. <br>The dominant activities in this sphere are argumentation and critique, which often <br>lead to further experiments and observations or to changes in proposed models, <br>explanations, or designs. Scientists and engineers use evidence-based argumenta-<br>tion to make the case for their ideas, whether involving new theories or designs, <br>novel ways of collecting data, or interpretations of evidence. They and their peers <br>then attempt to identify weaknesses and limitations in the argument, with the ulti-<br>mate goal of refining and improving the explanation or design.<br>In reality, scientists and engineers move, fluidly and iteratively, back and <br>forth among these three spheres of activity, and they conduct activities that might <br>involve two or even all three of the modes at once. The function of Figure 3-1 is <br>therefore solely to offer a scheme that helps identify the function, significance, <br>range, and diversity of practices embedded in the work of scientists and engineers. <br>Although admittedly a simplification, the figure does identify three overarching <br>categories of practices and shows how they interact. <br>How Engineering and Science Differ<br>Engineering and science are similar in that both involve creative processes, <br>and neither uses just one method. And just as scientific investigation has been <br>defined in different ways, engineering design has been described in various ways. <br>However, there is widespread agreement on the broad outlines of the engineering <br>design process [24, 25]. <br>Like scientific investigations, engineering design is both iterative and sys-<br>tematic. It is iterative in that each new version of the design is tested and then <br>modified, based on what has been learned up to that point. It is systematic in <br>that a number of characteristic steps must be undertaken. One step is identifying <br>the problem and defining specifications and constraints. Another step is generat-<br></span><span style="background-color: #FFADAD;" title="Chunk 56 | Start: 125036 | End: 127394 | Tokens: 509">ing ideas for how to solve the problem; engineers often use research and group <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Yet another step is the testing of potential <br>solutions through the building and testing of physical or mathematical models <br>and prototypes, all of which provide valuable data that cannot be obtained in <br>any other way. With data in hand, the engineer can analyze how well the various <br>solutions meet the given specifications and constraints and then evaluate what is <br>needed to improve the leading design or devise a better one. <br>In contrast, scientific studies may or may not be driven by any immedi-<br>ate practical application. On one hand, certain kinds of scientific research, such <br>as that which led to Pasteur’s fundamental contributions to the germ theory of <br>disease, were undertaken for practical purposes and resulted in important new <br>technologies, including vaccination for anthrax and rabies and the pasteurization <br>of milk to prevent spoilage.

For science, developing such an explanation constitutes success <br>in and of itself, regardless of whether it has an immediate practical application; <br>the goal of science is to develop a set of coherent and mutually consistent theoreti-<br>cal descriptions of the world that can provide explanations over a wide range of <br>phenomena, For engineering, however, success is measured by the extent to which <br>a human need or want has been addressed.<br></span><span style="background-color: #FFD6A5;" title="Chunk 57 | Start: 127394 | End: 129714 | Tokens: 499">Both scientists and engineers engage in argumentation, but they do so with <br>different goals. In engineering, the goal of argumentation is to evaluate prospec-<br>tive designs and then produce the most effective design for meeting the specifi-<br>cations and constraints. This optimization process typically involves trade-offs <br>between competing goals, with the consequence that there is never just one “cor-<br>rect” solution to a design challenge. Instead, there are a number of possible solu-<br>tions, and choosing among them inevitably involves personal as well as technical <br>and cost considerations. Moreover, the continual arrival of new technologies <br>enables new solutions.<br>In contrast, theories in science must meet a very different set of criteria, <br>such as parsimony (a preference for simpler solutions) and explanatory coherence <br>(essentially how well any new theory provides explanations of phenomena that fit <br>with observations and allow predictions or inferences about the past to be made). <br>Moreover, the aim of science is to find a single coherent and comprehensive theory <br>for a range of related phenomena.

We recognize that students <br>cannot reach the level of competence of professional scientists and engineers, any <br>more than a novice violinist is expected to attain the abilities of a virtuoso. Yet <br>students’ opportunities to immerse themselves in these practices and to explore <br>why they are central to science and engineering are critical to appreciating the skill <br>of the expert and the nature of his or her enterprise. <br>We consider eight practices to be essential elements of the K-12 science and <br>engineering curriculum:<br>1.	 Asking questions (for science) and defining problems (for engineering)<br>2.	 Developing and using models<br>3.	 Planning and carrying out investigations<br>4.	 Analyzing and interpreting data<br>5.	 Using mathematics and computational thinking<br>6.	 Constructing explanations (for science) and designing solutions (for <br>engineering)<br>7.	 Engaging in argument from evidence<br>8.	 Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information<br>In the eight subsections that follow, we address in turn each of these eight <br>practices in some depth. Each discussion describes the practice, articulates the <br>major competencies that students should have by the end of 12th grade (“Goals”), <br>and sketches how their competence levels might progress across the preceding <br>grades (“Progression”). These sketches are based on the committee’s judgment, as <br>there is very little research evidence as yet on the developmental trajectory of each <br>of these practices. The overall objective is that students develop both the facil-<br>ity and the inclination to call on these practices, separately or in combination, as <br>needed to support their learning and to demonstrate their understanding of science <br>and engineering. Box 3-2 briefly contrasts the role of each practice’s manifestation <br>in science with its counterpart in engineering.

Asking Questions and Defining Problems<br>Science begins with a question about a phe-<br>nomenon, such as “Why is the sky blue?” or <br>“What causes cancer?,” and seeks to develop <br>theories that can provide explanatory answers to <br>such questions. A basic practice of the scientist <br>is formulating empirically answerable questions <br>about phenomena, establishing what is already <br>known, and determining what questions have <br>yet to be satisfactorily answered. <br>Engineering begins with a problem, need, or desire <br>that suggests an engineering problem that needs to <br>be solved. A societal problem such as reducing the <br>nation’s dependence on fossil fuels may engender a <br>variety of engineering problems, such as designing <br>more efficient transportation systems, or alternative <br>power generation devices such as improved solar <br>cells. Engineers ask questions to define the engineer-<br>ing problem, determine criteria for a successful solu-<br>tion, and identify constraints.<br>2. Developing and Using Models<br>Science often involves the construction and use <br>of a wide variety of models and simulations to <br>help develop explanations about natural phe-<br>nomena. Models make it possible to go beyond <br>observables and imagine a world not yet seen. <br>Models enable predictions of the form “if . . . <br>then . . . therefore” to be made in order to test <br>hypothetical explanations. <br>Engineering makes use of models and simulations <br>to analyze existing systems so as to see where flaws <br>might occur or to test possible solutions to a new <br>problem. Engineers also call on models of various <br>sorts to test proposed systems and to recognize the <br>strengths and limitations of their designs.<br>3. Planning and Carrying Out Investigations <br>Scientific investigation may be conducted <br>in the field or the laboratory. A major practice of <br>scientists is planning and carrying out a system-<br>atic investigation, which requires the identifica-<br>tion of what is to be recorded and, if applicable, <br>what are to be treated as the dependent and <br>independent variables (control of variables). <br>Observations and data collected from such work <br></span><span style="background-color: #9BF6FF;" title="Chunk 60 | Start: 134123 | End: 136473 | Tokens: 502">are used to test existing theories and explana-<br>tions or to revise and develop new ones. <br>Engineers use investigation both to gain data <br>essential for specifying design criteria or parameters <br>and to test their designs. Like scientists, engineers <br>must identify relevant variables, decide how they <br>will be measured, and collect data for analysis. Their <br>investigations help them to identify how effective, <br>efficient, and durable their designs may be under a <br>range of conditions. <br>BOX 3-2<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>Dimension 1: Scientific and Engineering Practices<br>51<br>4. Analyzing and Interpreting Data<br>Scientific investigations produce data that <br>must be analyzed in order to derive meaning. <br>Because data usually do not speak for them-<br>selves, scientists use a range of tools—including <br>tabulation, graphical interpretation, visualization, <br>and statistical analysis—to identify the signifi-<br>cant features and patterns in the data. Sources <br>of error are identified and the degree of certainty <br>calculated. Modern technology makes the collec-<br>tion of large data sets much easier, thus provid-<br>ing many secondary sources for analysis.<br>Engineers analyze data collected in the tests of <br>their designs and investigations; this allows them <br>to compare different solutions and determine how <br>well each one meets specific design criteria—that <br>is, which design best solves the problem within the <br>given constraints. Like scientists, engineers require <br>a range of tools to identify the major patterns and <br>interpret the results. <br>5. Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking<br>In science, mathematics and computation <br>are fundamental tools for representing physi-<br>cal variables and their relationships. They are <br>used for a range of tasks, such as constructing <br>simulations, statistically analyzing data, and rec-<br>ognizing, expressing, and applying quantitative <br>relationships. Mathematical and computational <br>approaches enable predictions of the behavior of <br>physical systems, along with the testing of such <br>predictions. Moreover, statistical techniques are <br>invaluable for assessing the significance of pat-<br>terns or correlations. <br>In engineering, mathematical and computa-<br>tional representations of established relationships <br></span><span style="background-color: #A0C4FF;" title="Chunk 61 | Start: 136473 | End: 138796 | Tokens: 507">and principles are an integral part of design. For <br>example, structural engineers create mathematically <br>based analyses of designs to calculate whether they <br>can stand up to the expected stresses of use and if <br>they can be completed within acceptable budgets. <br>Moreover, simulations of designs provide an effective <br>test bed for the development of designs and their <br>improvement. <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions<br>The goal of science is the construction of theo-<br>ries that can provide explanatory accounts of <br>features of the world. A theory becomes accept-<br>ed when it has been shown to be superior to <br>other explanations in the breadth of phenomena <br>it accounts for and in its explanatory coherence <br>and parsimony. Scientific explanations are explic-<br>it applications of theory to a specific situation or <br>phenomenon, perhaps with the intermediary of a <br>theory-based model for the system under study. <br>The goal for students is to construct logically <br>coherent explanations of phenomena that incor-<br>porate their current understanding of science, <br>or a model that represents it, and are consistent <br>with the available evidence.<br>Engineering design, a systematic process for <br>solving engineering problems, is based on scien-<br>tific knowledge and models of the material world. <br>Each proposed solution results from a process of <br>balancing competing criteria of desired functions, <br>technological feasibility, cost, safety, esthetics, and <br>compliance with legal requirements. There is usually <br>no single best solution but rather a range of solu-<br>tions. Which one is the optimal choice depends on <br>the criteria used for making evaluations.<br>7. Engaging in Argument from Evidence<br>In science, reasoning and argument are <br>essential for identifying the strengths and weak-<br>nesses of a line of reasoning and for finding <br>the best explanation for a natural phenomenon. <br>Scientists must defend their explanations, for-<br>mulate evidence based on a solid foundation of <br>data, examine their own understanding in light <br>of the evidence and comments offered by oth-<br>ers, and collaborate with peers in searching for <br></span><span style="background-color: #BDB2FF;" title="Chunk 62 | Start: 138796 | End: 140989 | Tokens: 494">the best explanation for the phenomenon being <br>investigated.<br>In engineering, reasoning and argument are <br>essential for finding the best possible solution to <br>a problem. Engineers collaborate with their peers <br>throughout the design process, with a critical stage <br>being the selection of the most promising solution <br>among a field of competing ideas. Engineers use <br>systematic methods to compare alternatives, formu-<br>late evidence based on test data, make arguments <br>from evidence to defend their conclusions, evaluate <br>critically the ideas of others, and revise their designs <br>in order to achieve the best solution to the problem <br>at hand. <br>DISTINGUISHING PRACTICES IN SCIENCE FROM THOSE IN ENGINEERING<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information<br>Science cannot advance if scientists are <br>unable to communicate their findings clearly <br>and persuasively or to learn about the findings <br>of others. A major practice of science is thus <br>the communication of ideas and the results of <br>inquiry—orally, in writing, with the use of tables, <br>diagrams, graphs, and equations, and by engag-<br>ing in extended discussions with scientific peers. <br>Science requires the ability to derive meaning <br>from scientific texts (such as papers, the Internet, <br>symposia, and lectures), to evaluate the scientific <br>validity of the information thus acquired, and to <br>integrate that information.<br>Engineers cannot produce new or improved tech-<br>nologies if the advantages of their designs are not <br>communicated clearly and persuasively. Engineers <br>need to be able to express their ideas, orally and in <br>writing, with the use of tables, graphs, drawings, or <br>models and by engaging in extended discussions <br>with peers. Moreover, as with scientists, they need <br>to be able to derive meaning from colleagues’ texts, <br>evaluate the information, and apply it usefully. In <br>engineering and science alike, new technologies are <br>now routinely available that extend the possibilities <br>for collaboration and communication.<br></span><span style="background-color: #FFC6FF;" title="Chunk 63 | Start: 140989 | End: 143160 | Tokens: 506"><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Even <br>for individuals who do not become scientists or engineers, the ability to ask well-<br>defined questions is an important component of science literacy, helping to make <br>them critical consumers of scientific knowledge. <br>Scientific questions arise in a variety of ways. They can be driven by curios-<br>ity about the world (e.g., Why is the sky blue?). They can be inspired by a model’s <br>or theory’s predictions or by attempts to extend or refine a model or theory (e.g., <br>How does the particle model of matter explain the incompressibility of liquids?). <br>Or they can result from the need to provide better solutions to a problem. For <br>example, the question of why it is impossible to siphon water above a height of 32 <br>feet led Evangelista Torricelli (17th-century inventor of the barometer) to his dis-<br>coveries about the atmosphere and the identification of a vacuum. <br>Questions are also important in engineering. Engineers must be able to ask <br>probing questions in order to define an engineering problem. For example, they <br>may ask: What is the need or desire that underlies the problem? What are the <br>criteria (specifications) for a successful solution? What are the constraints? Other <br>questions arise when generating possible solutions: Will this solution meet the <br>design criteria? Can two or more ideas be combined to produce a better solution? <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFADAD;" title="Chunk 64 | Start: 143160 | End: 145419 | Tokens: 508"><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Facilitating such evolution will require a classroom culture that respects and <br>values good questions, that offers students opportunities to refine their questions <br>and questioning strategies, and that incorporates the teaching of effective ques-<br>tioning strategies across all grade levels.

Mental models <br>are internal, personal, idiosyncratic, incomplete, unstable, and essentially function-<br>al. They serve the purpose of being a tool for thinking with, making predictions, <br>and making sense of experience. Conceptual models, the focus of this section, are, <br>in contrast, explicit representations that are in some ways analogous to the phe-<br>nomena they represent. Conceptual models allow scientists and engineers to better <br>visualize and understand a phenomenon under investigation or develop a possible <br>solution to a design problem. Used in science and engineering as either structural, <br>functional, or behavioral analogs, albeit simplified, conceptual models include dia-<br>grams, physical replicas, mathematical representations, analogies, and computer <br>simulations. Although they do not correspond exactly to the more complicated <br>entity being modeled, they do bring certain features into focus while minimizing <br>or obscuring others. Because all models contain approximations and assumptions <br>that limit the range of validity of their application and the precision of their pre-<br>dictive power, it is important to recognize their limitations.<br>Conceptual models are in some senses the external articulation of the men-<br></span><span style="background-color: #FDFFB6;" title="Chunk 66 | Start: 147836 | End: 150142 | Tokens: 509">tal models that scientists hold and are strongly interrelated with mental models. <br>Building an understanding of models and their role in science helps students to <br>construct and revise mental models of phenomena.

Some of the models <br>used by scientists are mathemati-<br>cal; for example, the ideal gas law <br>is an equation derived from the <br>model of a gas as a set of point <br>masses engaged in perfectly elastic <br>collisions with each other and the <br>walls of the container—which is <br>a simplified model based on the <br>atomic theory of matter. For more <br>complex systems, mathematical <br>representations of physical systems <br>are used to create computer simu-<br>lations, which enable scientists to <br>predict the behavior of otherwise <br>intractable systems—for example, <br>the effects of increasing atmo-<br>spheric levels of carbon dioxide on agriculture in different regions of the world. <br>Models can be evaluated and refined through an iterative cycle of comparing their <br>predictions with the real world and then adjusting them, thereby potentially yield-<br>ing insights into the phenomenon being modeled. <br>Engineering makes use of models to analyze existing systems; this allows <br>engineers to see where or under what conditions flaws might develop or to test <br>possible solutions to a new problem. Engineers also use models to visualize a <br>design and take it to a higher level of refinement, to communicate a design’s fea-<br>tures to others, and as prototypes for testing design performance.

In the first, careful observation and <br>description often lead to identification of features that need to be explained or <br>questions that need to be explored. <br>The second goal requires investigations to test explanatory models of the <br>world and their predictions and whether the inferences suggested by these mod-<br>els are supported by data. Planning and designing such investigations require the <br>ability to design experimental or observational inquiries that are appropriate to <br>answering the question being asked or testing a hypothesis that has been formed. <br>This process begins by identifying the relevant variables and considering how they <br>might be observed, measured, and controlled (constrained by the experimental <br>design to take particular values). <br></span><span style="background-color: #A0C4FF;" title="Chunk 69 | Start: 154870 | End: 157173 | Tokens: 501">Planning for controls is an important part of the design of an investigation. <br>In laboratory experiments, it is critical to decide which variables are to be treated <br>as results or outputs and thus left to vary at will and which are to be treated as <br>input conditions and hence controlled.

Asking students to demonstrate <br>their own understanding of the implications of a scientific idea by developing <br>their own explanations of phenomena, whether based on observations they <br>have made or models they have developed, engages them in an essential part <br>of the process by which conceptual change can occur. Explanations in science <br>are a natural for such pedagogical uses, given their inherent appeals to simplic-<br>ity, analogy, and empirical data (which may even be in the form of a thought <br>experiment) [26, 27]. And explanations are especially valuable for the classroom <br>because of, rather than in spite of, the fact that there often are competing expla-<br>nations offered for the same phenomenon—for example, the recent gradual rise <br>in the mean surface temperature on Earth. Deciding on the best explanation is <br>a matter of argument that is resolved by how well any given explanation fits <br>with all available data, how much it simplifies what would seem to be complex, <br>and whether it produces a <br>sense of understanding.<br>Because scientists <br>achieve their own under-<br>standing by building <br>theories and theory-based <br>explanations with the aid <br>of models and represen-<br>tations and by drawing <br>on data and evidence, <br>students should also <br>develop some facility in <br>constructing model- or <br>evidence-based explana-<br>tions. This is an essential <br>step in building their own <br>understanding of phenomena, in gaining greater appreciation of the explana-<br>tory power of the scientific theories that they are learning about in class, and in <br>acquiring greater insight into how scientists operate. <br>In engineering, the goal is a design rather than an explanation. The process <br>of developing a design is iterative and systematic, as is the process of developing <br>an explanation or a theory in science. Engineers’ activities, however, have elements <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

These elements include specifying con-<br></span><span style="background-color: #FFC6FF;" title="Chunk 79 | Start: 178594 | End: 180938 | Tokens: 493">straints and criteria for desired qualities of the solution, developing a design plan, <br>producing and testing models or prototypes, selecting among alternative design <br>features to optimize the achievement of design criteria, and refining design ideas <br>based on the performance of a prototype or simulation. <br>GOALS<br>By grade 12, students should be able to<br>•	<br>Construct their own explanations of phenomena using their knowledge of <br>accepted scientific theory and linking it to models and evidence.<br>•	<br>Use primary or secondary scientific evidence and models to support or refute <br>an explanatory account of a phenomenon.<br>•	<br>Offer causal explanations appropriate to their level of scientific knowledge.<br>•	<br>Identify gaps or weaknesses in explanatory accounts (their own or those of <br>others).<br>In their experience of engineering, students should have the opportunity to<br>•	<br>Solve design problems by appropriately applying their scientific knowledge.<br>•	<br>Undertake design projects, engaging in all steps of the design cycle and pro-<br>ducing a plan that meets specific design criteria.<br>•	<br>Construct a device or implement a design solution.<br>•	<br>Evaluate and critique competing design solutions based on jointly developed <br>and agreed-on design criteria.<br>PROGRESSION FOR EXPLANATION<br>Early in their science education, students need opportunities to engage in con-<br>structing and critiquing explanations.

All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>70<br>another, they can develop causal accounts to explain what they observe. For <br>example, in investigating the conditions under which plants grow fastest, they may <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFADAD;" title="Chunk 80 | Start: 180938 | End: 183270 | Tokens: 498">notice that the plants die when kept in the dark and seek to develop an explana-<br>tion for this finding. Although the explanation at this level may be as simple as <br>“plants die in the dark because they need light in order to live and grow,” it pro-<br>vides a basis for further questions and deeper understanding of how plants utilize <br>light that can be developed in later grades. On the basis of comparison of their <br>explanation with their observations, students can appreciate that an explanation <br>such as “plants need light to grow” fails to explain why they die when no water <br>is provided. They should be encouraged to revisit their initial ideas and produce <br>more complete explanations that account for more of their observations. <br>By the middle grades, students recognize that many of the explanations <br>of science rely on models or representations of entities that are too small to <br>see or too large to visualize. For example, explaining why the temperature of <br>water does not increase beyond 100°C when heated requires students to envis-<br>age water as consisting of microscopic particles and that the energy provided by <br>heating can allow fast-moving particles to escape despite the force of attraction <br>holding the particles together. In the later stages of their education, students <br>should also progress to using mathematics or simulations to construct an expla-<br>nation for a phenomenon. <br>PROGRESSION FOR DESIGN<br>In some ways, children are natural engineers. They spontaneously build sand cas-<br>tles, dollhouses, and hamster enclosures, and they use a variety of tools and mate-<br>rials for their own playful purposes. Thus a common elementary school activity is <br>to challenge children to use tools and materials provided in class to solve a specific <br>challenge, such as constructing a bridge from paper and tape and testing it until <br>failure occurs. Children’s capabilities to design structures can then be enhanced by <br>having them pay attention to points of failure and asking them to create and test <br>redesigns of the bridge so that it is stronger. Furthermore, design activities should <br>not be limited just to structural engineering but should also include projects that <br>reflect other areas of engineering, such as the need to design a traffic pattern for <br>the school parking lot or a layout for planting a school garden box.<br></span><span style="background-color: #FFD6A5;" title="Chunk 81 | Start: 183270 | End: 185687 | Tokens: 506">In middle school, it is especially beneficial to engage students in engineer-<br>ing design projects in which they are expected to apply what they have recently <br>learned in science—for example, using their now-familiar concepts of ecology to <br>solve problems related to a school garden. Middle school students should also <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Increased empha-<br>sis should be placed on researching the nature of the given problems, on reviewing <br>others’ proposed solutions, on weighing the strengths and weaknesses of various <br>alternatives, and on discerning possibly unanticipated effects.<br>Practice 7	<br>Engaging in Argument from Evidence<br>Whether they concern new theories, proposed explanations of phenomena, novel <br>solutions to technological problems, or fresh interpretations of old data, scientists <br>and engineers use reasoning and argumentation to make their case. In science, the <br>production of knowledge is dependent on a process of reasoning that requires a <br>scientist to make a justified claim about the world. In response, other scientists <br>attempt to identify the claim’s weaknesses and limitations. Their arguments can be <br>based on deductions from premises, on inductive generalizations of existing pat-<br>terns, or on inferences about the best possible explanation. Argumentation is also <br>needed to resolve questions involving, for example, the best experimental design, <br>the most appropriate techniques of data analysis, or the best interpretation of a <br>given data set. <br>In short, science is replete with arguments that take place both informally, in <br>lab meetings and symposia, and formally, in peer review. Historical case studies of <br>the origin and development of a scientific idea show how a new idea is often dif-<br>ficult to accept and has to be argued for—archetypal examples are the Copernican <br></span><span style="background-color: #FDFFB6;" title="Chunk 82 | Start: 185687 | End: 188031 | Tokens: 508">idea that Earth travels around the sun and Darwin’s ideas about the origin of spe-<br>cies. Over time, ideas that survive critical examination even in the light of new <br>data attain consensual acceptance in the community, and by this process of dis-<br>course and argument science maintains its objectivity and progress [28].<br>The knowledge and ability to detect “bad science” [29, 30] are requirements <br>both for the scientist and the citizen. Scientists must make critical judgments about <br>their own work and that of their peers, and the scientist and the citizen alike must <br>make evaluative judgments about the validity of science-related media reports <br>and their implications for people’s own lives and society [30]. Becoming a critical <br>consumer of science is fostered by opportunities to use critique and evaluation to <br>judge the merits of any scientifically based argument.<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>72<br>In engineering, reasoning and argument are essential to finding the best <br>possible solution to a problem. At an early design stage, competing ideas must <br>be compared (and possibly combined) to achieve an initial design, and the <br>choices are made through argumentation about the merits of the various ideas <br>pertinent to the design goals. At a later stage in the design process, engineers <br>test their potential solution, collect data, and modify their design in an itera-<br>tive manner. The results of such efforts are often presented as evidence to argue <br>about the strengths and weaknesses of a particular design. Although the forms <br>of argumentation are similar, the criteria employed in engineering are often quite <br>different from those of science. For example, engineers might use cost-benefit <br>analysis, an analysis of risk, an appeal to aesthetics, or predictions about market <br>reception to justify why one design is better than another—or why an entirely <br>different course of action should be followed. <br>GOALS<br>By grade 12, students should be able to<br>•	<br>Construct a scientific argument showing how data support a claim.<br>•	<br>Identify possible weaknesses in scientific arguments, appropriate to the stu-<br>dents’ level of knowledge, and discuss them using reasoning and evidence.<br></span><span style="background-color: #CAFFBF;" title="Chunk 83 | Start: 188031 | End: 190451 | Tokens: 504"><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

In that spirit, <br>students should argue for the explanations they construct, defend their inter-<br>pretations of the associated data, and advocate for the designs they propose. <br>Meanwhile, they should learn how to evaluate critically the scientific arguments <br>of others and present counterarguments. Learning to argue scientifically offers <br>students not only an opportunity to use their scientific knowledge in justifying an <br>explanation and in identifying the weaknesses in others’ arguments but also to <br>build their own knowledge and understanding. Constructing and critiquing argu-<br>ments are both a core process of science and one that supports science education, <br>as research suggests that interaction with others is the most cognitively effective <br>way of learning [31-33].<br>Young students can begin by constructing an argument for their own <br>interpretation of the phenomena they observe and of any data they collect. <br>They need instructional support to go beyond simply making claims—that is, to <br>include reasons or references to evidence and to begin to distinguish evidence <br>from opinion. As they grow in their ability to construct scientific arguments, <br>students can draw on a wider range of reasons or evidence, so that their argu-<br></span><span style="background-color: #9BF6FF;" title="Chunk 84 | Start: 190451 | End: 192769 | Tokens: 494">ments become more sophisticated. In addition, they should be expected to dis-<br>cern what aspects of the evidence are potentially significant for supporting or <br>refuting a particular argument.<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>74<br>Students should begin learning to critique by asking questions about their <br>own findings and those of others. Later, they should be expected to identify pos-<br>sible weaknesses in either data or an argument and explain why their criticism is <br>justified. As they become more adept at arguing and critiquing, they should be <br>introduced to the language needed to talk about argument, such as claim, reason, <br>data, etc. Exploration of historical episodes in science can provide opportunities <br>for students to identify the ideas, evidence, and arguments of professional scien-<br>tists. In so doing, they should be encouraged to recognize the criteria used to judge <br>claims for new knowledge and the formal means by which scientific ideas are <br>evaluated today. In particular, they should see how the practice of peer review and <br>independent verification of claimed experimental results help to maintain objectiv-<br>ity and trust in science.<br>Practice 8	<br>Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information<br>Being literate in science and engineering requires the ability to read and under-<br>stand their literatures [34]. Science and engineering are ways of knowing that <br>are represented and communicated by words, diagrams, charts, graphs, images, <br>symbols, and mathematics [35]. Reading, interpreting, and producing text* are <br>fundamental practices of science in particular, and they constitute at least half of <br>engineers’ and scientists’ total working time [36]. <br>Even when students have developed grade-level-appropriate reading skills, <br>reading in science is often challenging to students for three reasons. First, the <br>jargon of science texts is essentially unfamiliar; together with their often exten-<br>sive use of, for example, the passive voice and complex sentence structure, many <br>find these texts inaccessible [37]. Second, science texts must be read so as to <br>extract information accurately. Because the precise meaning of each word or <br></span><span style="background-color: #A0C4FF;" title="Chunk 85 | Start: 192769 | End: 195200 | Tokens: 506">clause may be important, such texts require a mode of reading that is quite dif-<br>ferent from reading a novel or even a newspaper. Third, science texts are multi-<br>modal [38], using a mix of words, diagrams, charts, symbols, and mathematics <br>to communicate. Thus understanding science texts requires much more than sim-<br>ply knowing the meanings of technical terms. <br>Communicating in written or spoken form is another fundamental practice of <br>science; it requires scientists to describe observations precisely, clarify their thinking, <br>and justify their arguments.

Indeed, the new Common Core State <br>Standards for English Language Arts &amp; Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science, <br>and Technical Subjects [39] recognize that reading and writing skills are essential to <br>science; the formal inclusion in this framework of this science practice reinforces and <br>expands on that view. Science simply cannot advance if scientists are unable to com-<br>municate their findings clearly and persuasively. Communication occurs in a variety <br>of formal venues, including peer-reviewed journals, books, conference presenta-<br>tions, and carefully constructed websites; it occurs as well through informal means, <br>such as discussions, email messages, phone calls, and blogs. New technologies have <br>extended communicative practices, enabling multidisciplinary collaborations across <br>the globe that place even more emphasis on reading and writing. Increasingly, too, <br>scientists are required to engage in dialogues with lay audiences about their work, <br>which requires especially good communication skills.<br>Being a critical consumer of science and the products of engineering, whether as <br>a lay citizen or a practicing scientist or an engineer, also requires the ability to read or <br>view reports about science in the press or on the Internet and to recognize the salient <br></span><span style="background-color: #BDB2FF;" title="Chunk 86 | Start: 195200 | End: 197608 | Tokens: 511">science, identify sources of error and methodological flaws, and distinguish observa-<br>tions from inferences, arguments from explanations, and claims from evidence. All of <br>these are constructs learned from engaging in a critical discourse around texts.<br>Engineering proceeds in a similar manner because engineers need to communi-<br>cate ideas and find and exchange information—for example, about new techniques <br>or new uses of existing tools and materials. As in science, engineering communica-<br>tion involves not just written and spoken language; many engineering ideas are best <br>communicated through sketches, diagrams, graphs, models, and products. Also <br>in wide use are handbooks, specific to particular engineering fields, that provide <br>detailed information, often in tabular form, on how best to formulate design solu-<br>tions to commonly encountered engineering tasks.

It follows that to master the reading of scientific material, students <br>need opportunities to engage with such text and to identify its major features; they <br>cannot be expected simply to apply reading skills learned elsewhere to master this <br>unfamiliar genre effectively. <br>Students should write accounts of their work, using journals to record <br>observations, thoughts, ideas, and models. They should be encouraged to create <br>diagrams and to represent data and observations with plots and tables, as well <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFADAD;" title="Chunk 88 | Start: 200067 | End: 202621 | Tokens: 511">as with written text, in these journals. They should also begin to produce reports <br>or posters that present their work to others. As students begin to read and write <br>more texts, the particular genres of scientific text—a report of an investigation, <br>an explanation with supporting argumentation, an experimental procedure—will <br>need to be introduced and their purpose explored. Furthermore, students should <br>have opportunities to engage in discussion about observations and explanations <br>and to make oral presentations of their results and conclusions as well as to <br>engage in appropriate discourse with other students by asking questions and dis-<br>cussing issues raised in such presentations. Because the spoken language of such <br>discussions and presentations is as far from their everyday language as scientific <br>text is from a novel, the development both of written and spoken scientific expla-<br>nation/argumentation needs to proceed in parallel.<br>In high school, these practices should be further developed by providing <br>students with more complex texts and a wider range of text materials, such as <br>technical reports or scientific literature on the Internet. Moreover, students need <br>opportunities to read and discuss general media reports with a critical eye and to <br>read appropriate samples of adapted primary literature [40] to begin seeing how <br>science is communicated by science practitioners. <br>In engineering, students likewise need opportunities to communicate ideas <br>using appropriate combinations of sketches, models, and language.

Understanding how science has <br>achieved this success and the techniques that it uses is an essential part of any <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFD6A5;" title="Chunk 89 | Start: 202621 | End: 204973 | Tokens: 496">science education. Although there is no universal agreement about teaching <br>the nature of science, there is a strong consensus about characteristics of the <br>scientific enterprise that should be understood by an educated citizen [41-43]. <br>For example, the notion that there is a single scientific method of observation, <br>hypothesis, deduction, and conclusion—a myth perpetuated to this day by many <br>textbooks—is fundamentally wrong [44]. Scientists do use deductive reasoning, <br>but they also search for patterns, classify different objects, make generalizations <br>from repeated observations, and engage in a process of making inferences as to <br>what might be the best explanation. Thus the picture of scientific reasoning is <br>richer, more complex, and more diverse than the image of a linear and unitary <br>scientific method would suggest [45]. <br>What engages all scientists, however, is a process of critique and argumenta-<br>tion. Because they examine each other’s ideas and look for flaws, controversy and <br>debate among scientists are normal occurrences, neither exceptional nor extraor-<br>dinary. Moreover, science has established a formal mechanism of peer review for <br>establishing the credibility of any individual scientist’s work. The ideas that sur-<br>vive this process of review and criticism are the ones that become well established <br>in the scientific community.<br>Our view is that the opportunity for students to learn the basic set of prac-<br>tices outlined in this chapter is also an opportunity to have them stand back and <br>reflect on how these practices contribute to the accumulation of scientific knowl-<br>edge. For example, students need to see that the construction of models is a major <br>means of acquiring new understanding; that these models identify key features and <br>are akin to a map, rather than a literal representation of reality [13]; and that the <br>great achievement of science is a core set of explanatory theories that have wide <br>application [46]. <br>Understanding how science functions requires a synthesis of content <br>knowledge, procedural knowledge, and epistemic knowledge. Procedural knowl-<br>edge refers to the methods that scientists use to ensure that their findings are <br>valid and reliable. It includes an understanding of the importance and appropri-<br>ate use of controls, double-blind trials, and other procedures (such as methods <br></span><span style="background-color: #FDFFB6;" title="Chunk 90 | Start: 204973 | End: 207269 | Tokens: 508">to reduce error) used by science. As such, much of it is specific to the domain <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>Dimension 1: Scientific and Engineering Practices<br>79<br>and can only be learned within science. Procedural knowledge has also been <br>called “concepts of evidence” [47]. <br>Epistemic knowledge is knowledge of the constructs and values that are <br>intrinsic to science. Students need to understand what is meant, for example, by <br>an observation, a hypothesis, an inference, a model, a theory, or a claim and be <br>able to readily distinguish between them. An education in science should show <br>that new scientific ideas are acts of imagination, commonly created these days <br>through collaborative efforts of groups of scientists whose critiques and arguments <br>are fundamental to establishing which ideas are worthy of pursuing further. Ideas <br>often survive because they are coherent with what is already known, and they <br>either explain the unexplained, explain more observations, or explain in a simpler <br>and more elegant manner. <br>Science is replete with ideas that once seemed promising but have not with-<br>stood the test of time, such as the concept of the “ether” or the vis vitalis (the <br>“vital force” of life). Thus any new idea is initially tentative, but over time, as it <br>survives repeated testing, it can acquire the status of a fact—a piece of knowledge <br>that is unquestioned and uncontested, such as the existence of atoms. Scientists <br>use the resulting theories and the models that represent them to explain and pre-<br>dict causal relationships. When the theory is well tested, its predictions are reli-<br>able, permitting the application of science to technologies and a wide variety of <br>policy decisions. In other words, science is not a miscellany of facts but a coherent <br>body of knowledge that has been hard won and that serves as a powerful tool. <br>Engagement in modeling and in critical and evidence-based argumentation <br>invites and encourages students to reflect on the status of their own knowledge <br>and their understanding of how science works. And as they involve themselves <br>in the practices of science and come to appreciate its basic nature, their level of <br></span><span style="background-color: #CAFFBF;" title="Chunk 91 | Start: 207269 | End: 208983 | Tokens: 509">sophistication in understanding how any given practice contributes to the scientific <br>enterprise can continue to develop across all grade levels. <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

All rights reserved.<br>83<br>Some important themes pervade science, mathematics, and technology and appear over <br>and over again, whether we are looking at an ancient civilization, the human body, or a <br>comet. They are ideas that transcend disciplinary boundaries and prove fruitful in expla-<br>nation, in theory, in observation, and in design.<br>—American Association for the Advancement of Science [1].<br>I<br>n this chapter, we describe concepts that bridge disciplinary boundaries, having <br>explanatory value throughout much of science and engineering. These crosscut-<br>ting concepts were selected for their value across the sciences and in engineer-<br>ing. These concepts help provide students with an organizational framework for <br>connecting knowledge from the various disciplines into a coherent and scientifi-<br>cally based view of the world. <br>Although crosscutting concepts are fundamental to an understanding of sci-<br>ence and engineering, students have often been expected to build such knowledge <br>without any explicit instructional support. Hence the purpose of highlighting them <br>as Dimension 2 of the framework is to elevate their role in the development of <br>standards, curricula, instruction, and assessments. These concepts should become <br>common and familiar touchstones across the disciplines and grade levels. Explicit <br>reference to the concepts, as well as their emergence in multiple disciplinary con-<br>texts, can help students develop a cumulative, coherent, and usable understanding <br>of science and engineering. <br>Although we do not specify grade band endpoints for the crosscutting <br>concepts, we do lay out a hypothetical progression for each.

For <br>this reason, the progressions we describe should be treated as hypotheses that <br>require further empirical investigation.<br>SEVEN CROSSCUTTING CONCEPTS OF THE FRAMEWORK<br>The committee identified seven crosscutting scientific and engineering concepts:<br>1.	 Patterns. Observed patterns of forms and events guide organization and <br>classification, and they prompt questions about relationships and the fac-<br>tors that influence them. <br>2.	 Cause and effect: Mechanism and explanation. Events have causes, <br>sometimes simple, sometimes multifaceted. A major activity of science <br>is investigating and explaining causal relationships and the mechanisms <br>by which they are mediated. Such mechanisms can then be tested across <br>given contexts and used to predict and explain events in new contexts.<br>3.	 Scale, proportion, and quantity. In considering phenomena, it is critical <br>to recognize what is relevant at different measures of size, time, and ener-<br>gy and to recognize how changes in scale, proportion, or quantity affect <br>a system’s structure or performance. <br>4.	 Systems and system models. Defining the system under study—specify-<br>ing its boundaries and making explicit a model of that system—provides <br>tools for understanding and testing ideas that are applicable throughout <br>science and engineering. <br>5.	 Energy and matter: Flows, cycles, and conservation. Tracking fluxes of <br>energy and matter into, out of, and within systems helps one understand <br>the systems’ possibilities and limitations. <br>6.	 Structure and function. The way in which an object or living thing is <br>shaped and its substructure determine many of its properties and <br>functions.<br>7.	 Stability and change. For natural and built systems alike, conditions of <br>stability and determinants of rates of change or evolution of a system are <br>critical elements of study.<br>This set of crosscutting concepts begins with two concepts that are funda-<br>mental to the nature of science: that observed patterns can be explained and that <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Each concept also stands alone as one <br>that occurs in virtually all areas of science and is an important consideration for <br>engineered systems as well. <br>The set of crosscutting concepts defined here is similar to those that <br>appear in other standards documents, in which they have been called “unifying <br>concepts” or “common themes” [2-4]. Regardless of the labels or organizational <br>schemes used in these documents, all of them stress that it is important for stu-<br>dents to come to recognize the concepts common to so many areas of science <br>and engineering.<br>Patterns <br>Patterns exist everywhere—in regularly occurring shapes or structures and in <br>repeating events and relationships. For example, patterns are discernible in the <br>symmetry of flowers and snowflakes, the cycling of the seasons, and the repeated <br>base pairs of DNA. Noticing patterns is often a first step to <br>organizing and asking scientific questions about why and <br>how the patterns occur. <br>One major use of pattern recognition is in classifica-<br>tion, which depends on careful observation of similarities <br>and differences; objects can be classified into groups on the <br>basis of similarities of visible or microscopic features or on <br>the basis of similarities of function. Such classification is <br>useful in codifying relationships and organizing a multitude <br>of objects or processes into a limited number of groups. <br>Patterns of similarity and difference and the resulting clas-<br>sifications may change, depending on the scale at which a <br>phenomenon is being observed. For example, isotopes of a <br>given element are different—they contain different numbers <br>of neutrons—but from the perspective of chemistry they <br>can be classified as equivalent because they have identical patterns of chemical <br>interaction. Once patterns and variations have been noted, they lead to questions; <br></span><span style="background-color: #CAFFBF;" title="Chunk 99 | Start: 222587 | End: 224952 | Tokens: 499"><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>86<br>scientists seek explanations for observed patterns and for the similarity and diver-<br>sity within them. Engineers often look for and analyze patterns, too. For example, <br>they may diagnose patterns of failure of a designed system under test in order <br>to improve the design, or they may analyze patterns of daily and seasonal use of <br>power to design a system that can meet the fluctuating needs.<br>The ways in which data are represented can facilitate pattern recognition <br>and lead to the development of a mathematical representation, which can then be <br>used as a tool in seeking an underlying explanation for what causes the pattern to <br>occur. For example, biologists studying changes in population abundance of sev-<br>eral different species in an ecosystem can notice the correlations between increases <br>and decreases for different species by plotting all of them on the same graph and <br>can eventually find a mathematical expression of the interdependences and food-<br>web relationships that cause these patterns.<br>Progression<br>Human beings are good at recognizing patterns; indeed, young children begin to <br>recognize patterns in their own lives well before coming to school. They observe, <br>for example, that the sun and the moon follow different patterns of appearance <br>in the sky. Once they are students, it is important for them to develop ways <br>to recognize, classify, and record patterns in the phenomena they observe. For <br>example, elementary students can describe and predict the patterns in the sea-<br>sons of the year; they can observe and record patterns in the similarities and <br>differences between parents and their offspring. Similarly, they can investigate <br>the characteristics that allow classification of animal types (e.g., mammals, fish, <br>insects), of plants (e.g., trees, shrubs, grasses), or of materials (e.g., wood, rock, <br>metal, plastic). <br>These classifications will become more detailed and closer to scientific <br>classifications in the upper elementary grades, when students should also begin <br>to analyze patterns in rates of change—for example, the growth rates of plants <br>under different conditions. By middle school, students can begin to relate patterns <br></span><span style="background-color: #9BF6FF;" title="Chunk 100 | Start: 224952 | End: 227257 | Tokens: 500">to the nature of microscopic and atomic-level structure—for example, they may <br>note that chemical molecules contain particular ratios of different atoms.

Thus classifications used at one scale <br>may fail or need revision when information from smaller or larger scales is intro-<br>duced (e.g., classifications based on DNA comparisons versus those based on vis-<br>ible characteristics). <br>Cause and Effect: Mechanism and Prediction<br>Many of the most compelling and productive questions in science are about why <br>or how something happens. Any tentative answer, or “hypothesis,” that A causes <br>B requires a model for the chain of interactions that connect A and B. For exam-<br>ple, the notion that diseases can be transmitted by a person’s touch was initially <br>treated with skepticism by the medical profession for lack of a plausible mecha-<br>nism. Today infectious diseases are well understood as being transmitted by the <br>passing of microscopic organisms (bacteria or viruses) between an infected person <br>and another. A major activity of science is to uncover such causal connections, <br>often with the hope that understanding the mechanisms will enable predictions <br>and, in the case of infectious diseases, the design of preventive measures, treat-<br>ments, and cures. <br>Repeating patterns in nature, or events that occur together with regular-<br>ity, are clues that scientists can use to start exploring causal, or cause-and-effect, <br>relationships, which pervade all the disciplines of science and at all scales. For <br>example, researchers investigate cause-and-effect mechanisms in the motion of <br>a single object, specific chemical reactions, population changes in an ecosys-<br>tem or a society, and the development of holes in the polar ozone layers. Any <br>application of science, or any engineered solution to a problem, is dependent on <br></span><span style="background-color: #A0C4FF;" title="Chunk 101 | Start: 227257 | End: 229591 | Tokens: 511">understanding the cause-and-effect relationships between events; the quality of <br>the application or solution often can be improved as knowledge of the relevant <br>relationships is improved.<br>Identifying cause and effect may seem straightforward in simple cases, such <br>as a bat hitting a ball, but in complex systems causation can be difficult to tease <br>out. It may be conditional, so that A can cause B only if some other factors are <br>in place or within a certain numerical range. For example, seeds germinate and <br>produce plants but only when the soil is sufficiently moist and warm. Frequently, <br>causation can be described only in a probabilistic fashion—that is, there is some <br>likelihood that one event will lead to another, but a specific outcome cannot be <br>guaranteed. For example, one can predict the fraction of a collection of identical <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>88<br>atoms that will undergo radioactive decay in a certain period but not the exact <br>time at which a given atom decays.<br>One assumption of all science and engineering is that there is a limited and <br>universal set of fundamental physical interactions that underlie all known forces <br>and hence are a root part of any causal chain, whether in natural or designed sys-<br>tems. Such “universality” means that the physical laws underlying all processes are <br>the same everywhere and at all times; they depend on gravity, electromagnetism, <br>or weak and strong nuclear interactions. Underlying all biological processes—the <br>inner workings of a cell or even of a brain—are particular physical and chemical <br>processes. At the larger scale of biological systems, the universality of life mani-<br>fests itself in a common genetic code.<br>Causation invoked to explain larger scale systems must be consistent with <br>the implications of what is known about smaller scale processes within the system, <br>even though new features may emerge at large scales that cannot be predicted <br>from knowledge of smaller scales. For example, although knowledge of atoms is <br>not sufficient to predict the genetic code, the replication of genes must be under-<br>stood as a molecular-level process. Indeed, the ability to model causal processes <br></span><span style="background-color: #BDB2FF;" title="Chunk 102 | Start: 229591 | End: 231890 | Tokens: 501">in complex multipart systems arises from this fact; modern computational codes <br>incorporate relevant smaller scale relationships into the model of the larger sys-<br>tem, integrating multiple factors in a way that goes well beyond the capacity of <br>the human brain.<br>In engineering, the goal is to design a system to cause a desired effect, so <br>cause-and-effect relationships are as much a part of engineering as of science. <br>Indeed, the process of design is a good place to help students begin to think in <br>terms of cause and effect, because they must understand the underlying causal <br>relationships in order to devise and explain a design that can achieve a speci-<br>fied objective. <br>One goal of instruction about cause and effect is to encourage students to <br>see events in the world as having understandable causes, even when these causes <br>are beyond human control. The ability to distinguish between scientific causal <br>claims and nonscientific causal claims is also an important goal. <br>Progression<br>In the earliest grades, as students begin to look for and analyze patterns—whether <br>in their observations of the world or in the relationships between different quanti-<br>ties in data (e.g., the sizes of plants over time)—they can also begin to consider <br>what might be causing these patterns and relationships and design tests that gather <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

By the upper elementary grades, <br>students should have developed the habit of routinely asking about cause-and-<br>effect relationships in the systems they are studying, particularly when something <br>occurs that is, for them, unexpected. The questions “How did that happen?” or <br>“Why did that happen?” should move toward “What mechanisms caused that to <br>happen?” and “What conditions were critical for that to happen?”<br>In middle and high school, argumentation starting from students’ own <br>explanations of cause and effect can help them appreciate standard scientific <br>theories that explain the causal mechanisms in the systems under study. Strategies <br>for this type of instruction include asking students to argue from evidence when <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFC6FF;" title="Chunk 103 | Start: 231890 | End: 234101 | Tokens: 511">attributing an observed phenomenon to a specific cause. For example, students <br>exploring why the population of a given species is shrinking will look for evidence <br>in the ecosystem of factors that lead to food shortages, overpredation, or other <br>factors in the habitat related to survival; they will provide an argument for how <br>these and other observed changes affect the species of interest.<br>Scale, Proportion, and Quantity<br>In thinking scientifically about systems and processes, it is essential to recognize <br>that they vary in size (e.g., cells, whales, galaxies), in time span (e.g., nanoseconds, <br>hours, millennia), in the amount of energy flowing through them (e.g., lightbulbs, <br>power grids, the sun), and in the relationships between the scales of these differ-<br>ent quantities. The understanding of relative magnitude is only a starting point. <br>As noted in Benchmarks for Science Literacy, “The large idea is that the way in <br>which things work may change with scale. Different aspects of nature change at <br>different rates with changes in scale, and so the relationships among them change, <br>too” [4]. Appropriate understanding of scale relationships is critical as well to <br>engineering—no structure could be conceived, much less constructed, without the <br>engineer’s precise sense of scale.<br>From a human perspective, one can separate three major scales at which <br>to study science: (1) macroscopic scales that are directly observable—that is, <br>what one can see, touch, feel, or manipulate; (2) scales that are too small or fast <br>to observe directly; and (3) those that are too large or too slow. Objects at the <br>atomic scale, for example, may be described with simple models, but the size of <br>atoms and the number of atoms in a system involve magnitudes that are difficult <br>to imagine. At the other extreme, science deals in scales that are equally dif-<br>ficult to imagine because they are so large—continents that move, for example, <br>and galaxies in which the nearest star is 4 years away traveling at the speed of <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

As size scales change, so do time scales. Thus, when considering large enti-<br>ties such as mountain ranges, one typically needs to consider change that occurs <br>over long periods. Conversely, changes in a small-scale system, such as a cell, are <br>viewed over much shorter times. However, it is important to recognize that pro-<br>cesses that occur locally and on short time scales can have long-term and large-<br>scale impacts as well.<br>In forming a concept of the very small and the very large, whether in space <br>or time, it is important to have a sense not only of relative scale sizes but also of <br>what concepts are meaningful at what scale. For example, the concept of solid <br>matter is meaningless at the subatomic scale, and the concept that light takes time <br>to travel a given distance becomes more important as one considers large distances <br>across the universe. <br>Understanding scale requires some insight into measurement and an ability <br>to think in terms of orders of magnitude—for example, to comprehend the dif-<br>ference between one in a hundred and a few parts per billion. At a basic level, in <br>order to identify something as bigger or smaller than something else—and how <br>much bigger or smaller—a student must appreciate the units used to measure it <br>and develop a feel for quantity. <br>The ideas of ratio and proportionality as used in science can extend and <br>challenge students’ mathematical understanding of these concepts. To appreci-<br>ate the relative magnitude of some properties or processes, it may be necessary to <br>grasp the relationships among different types of quantities—for example, speed as <br>the ratio of distance traveled to time taken, density as a ratio of mass to volume. <br>This use of ratio is quite different than a ratio of numbers describing fractions of <br>a pie. Recognition of such relationships among different quantities is a key step in <br>forming mathematical models that interpret scientific data. <br>Progression<br>The concept of scale builds from the early grades as an essential element of under-<br>standing phenomena. Young children can begin understanding scale with objects, <br>space, and time related to their world and with explicit scale models and maps. <br>They may discuss relative scales—the biggest and smallest, hottest and coolest, <br>fastest and slowest—without reference to particular units of measurement. <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFD6A5;" title="Chunk 105 | Start: 236450 | End: 238783 | Tokens: 498">Typically, units of measurement are first introduced in the context of <br>length, in which students can recognize the need for a common unit of mea-<br>sure—even develop their own before being introduced to standard units—<br>through appropriately constructed experiences.

They can also develop an <br>understanding of estimation across scales and contexts, which is important for <br>making sense of data. As students become more sophisticated, the use of estima-<br>tion can help them not only to develop a sense of the size and time scales relevant <br>to various objects, systems, and processes but also to consider whether a numeri-<br>cal result sounds reasonable. Students acquire the ability as well to move back and <br>forth between models at various scales, depending on the question being consid-<br>ered. They should develop a sense of the powers-of-10 scales and what phenom-<br>ena correspond to what scale, from the size of the nucleus of an atom to the size <br>of the galaxy and beyond. <br>Well-designed instruction is needed if students are to assign meaning to the <br>types of ratios and proportional relationships they encounter in science. Thus the <br>ability to recognize mathematical relationships between quantities should begin <br>developing in the early grades with students’ representations of counting (e.g., <br>leaves on a branch), comparisons of amounts (e.g., of flowers on different plants), <br>measurements (e.g., the height of a plant), and the ordering of quantities such as <br>number, length, and weight. Students can then explore more sophisticated math-<br>ematical representations, such as the use of graphs to represent data collected. The <br>interpretation of these graphs may be, for example, that a plant gets bigger as time <br>passes or that the hours of daylight decrease and increase across the months. <br></span><span style="background-color: #FDFFB6;" title="Chunk 106 | Start: 238783 | End: 241106 | Tokens: 508">As students deepen their understanding of algebraic thinking, they should <br>be able to apply it to examine their scientific data to predict the effect of a <br>change in one variable on another, for example, or to appreciate the difference <br>between linear growth and exponential growth.

A good system model for use in developing scientific explanations or <br>engineering designs must specify not only the parts, or subsystems, of the system <br>but also how they interact with one another. It must also specify the boundary of <br>the system being modeled, delineating what is included in the model and what is <br>to be treated as external. In a simple mechanical system, interactions among the <br>parts are describable in terms of forces among them that cause changes in motion <br>or physical stresses. In more complex systems, it is not always possible or useful to <br>consider interactions at this detailed mechanical level, yet it is equally important <br>to ask what interactions are occurring (e.g., predator-prey relationships in an eco-<br>system) and to recognize that they all involve transfers of energy, matter, and (in <br></span><span style="background-color: #9BF6FF;" title="Chunk 108 | Start: 243352 | End: 245665 | Tokens: 498">some cases) information among parts of the system. <br>Any model of a system incorporates assumptions and approximations; the <br>key is to be aware of what they are and how they affect the model’s reliability and <br>precision.

By high school, students <br>should also be able to identify the assumptions and approximations that have <br>been built into a model and discuss how they limit the precision and reliability of <br>its predictions. <br>Instruction should also include discussion of the interactions within a sys-<br>tem. As understanding deepens, students can move from a vague notion of interac-<br>tion as one thing affecting another to more explicit realizations of a system’s phys-<br>ical, chemical, biological, and social interactions and of their relative importance <br>for the question at hand. Students’ ideas about the interactions in a system and the <br>explication of such interactions in their models should become more sophisticated <br>in parallel with their understanding of the microscopic world (atoms, molecules, <br>biological cells, microbes) and with their ability to interpret and use more complex <br>mathematical relationships. <br>Modeling is also a tool that students can use in gauging their own knowl-<br>edge and clarifying their questions about a system. Student-developed models may <br>reveal problems or progress in their conceptions of the system, just as scientists’ <br>models do.

The supply of energy and of each needed <br>chemical element restricts a system’s operation—for example, without inputs of <br>energy (sunlight) and matter (carbon dioxide and water), a plant cannot grow. <br>Hence, it is very informative to track the transfers of matter and energy within, <br>into, or out of any system under study. <br>In many systems there also are cycles of various types. In some cases, the <br>most readily observable cycling may be of matter—for example, water going back <br>and forth between Earth’s atmosphere and its surface and subsurface reservoirs. <br>Any such cycle of matter also involves associated energy transfers at each stage, <br>so to fully understand the water cycle, one must model not only how water moves <br>between parts of the system but also the energy transfer mechanisms that are criti-<br>cal for that motion.<br>Consideration of energy and matter inputs, outputs, and flows or transfers <br>within a system or process are equally important for engineering.

For this reason, the concept is not developed at <br>all in K-2 and only very generally in grades 3-5. Instead, the elementary grades <br>focus on recognition of conservation of matter and of the flow of matter into, <br>out of, and within systems under study. The role of energy transfers in conjunc-<br>tion with these flows is not introduced until the middle grades and only fully <br>developed by high school. <br>Clearly, incorrect beliefs—such as the perception that food or fuel is a form <br>of energy—would lead to elementary grade students’ misunderstanding of the <br>nature of energy. Hence, although the necessity for food or fuel can be discussed, <br>the language of energy needs to be used with care so as not to further estab-<br>lish such misconceptions. By middle school, a more precise idea of energy—for <br>example, the understanding that food or fuel undergoes a chemical reaction with <br>oxygen that releases stored energy—can emerge. The common misconceptions can <br>be addressed with targeted instructional interventions (including student-led inves-<br>tigations), and appropriate terminology can be used in discussing energy across <br>the disciplines. <br>Matter transfers are less fraught in this respect, but the idea of atoms is not <br>introduced with any specificity until middle school. Thus, at the level of grades <br>3-5, matter flows and cycles can be tracked only in terms of the weight of the sub-<br>stances before and after a process occurs, such as sugar dissolving in water. Mass/<br>weight distinctions and the idea of atoms and their conservation (except in nuclear <br>processes) are taught in grades 6-8, with nuclear substructure and the related con-<br>servation laws for nuclear processes introduced in grades 9-12. <br>Structure and Function<br>As expressed by the National Research Council in 1996 and reiterated by the <br>College Board in 2009, “Form and function are complementary aspects of objects, <br>organisms, and systems in the natural and designed world. . . . Understanding <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFADAD;" title="Chunk 112 | Start: 252773 | End: 255128 | Tokens: 509">of form and function applies to different levels of organization.

A sense of scale is necessary in order to know what proper-<br>ties and what aspects of shape or material are relevant at a particular magnitude or <br>in investigating particular phenomena—that is, the selection of an appropriate scale <br>depends on the question being asked. For example, the substructures of molecules <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

However, building a lighter bicycle may require knowledge of the proper-<br>ties (such as rigidity and hardness) of the materials needed for specific parts of <br>the bicycle. In that way, the builder can seek less dense materials with appropriate <br>properties; this pursuit may lead in turn to an examination of the atomic-scale <br>structure of candidate materials. As a result, new parts with the desired properties, <br>possibly made of new materials, can be designed and fabricated.<br>Progression<br>Exploration of the relationship between structure and function can begin in <br>the early grades through investigations of accessible and visible systems in the <br>natural and human-built world. For example, children explore how shape and <br>stability are related for a variety of structures (e.g., a bridge’s diagonal brace) <br>or purposes (e.g., different animals get their food using different parts of their <br>bodies). As children move through the elementary grades, they progress to <br>understanding the relationships of structure and <br>mechanical function (e.g., wheels and axles, <br>gears). For upper-elementary students, the con-<br></span><span style="background-color: #FFD6A5;" title="Chunk 113 | Start: 255128 | End: 257318 | Tokens: 504">cept of matter having a substructure at a scale <br>too small to see is related to properties of mate-<br>rials; for example, a model of a gas as a collec-<br>tion of moving particles (not further defined) <br>may be related to observed properties of gases. <br>Upper-elementary students can also examine <br>more complex structures, such as subsystems of <br>the human body, and consider the relationship <br>of the shapes of the parts to their functions. By <br>the middle grades, students begin to visualize, <br>model, and apply their understanding of structure and function to more complex <br>or less easily observable systems and processes (e.g., the structure of water and <br>salt molecules and solubility, Earth’s plate tectonics). For students in the middle <br>grades, the concept of matter having a submicroscopic structure is related to <br>properties of materials; for example, a model based on atoms and/or molecules <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

They recognize that often the first step <br>in deciphering how a system works is to examine in detail what it is made of <br>and the shapes of its parts. In building something—say, a mechanical system—<br>they likewise apply relationships of structure and function as critical elements of <br>successful designs. <br>Stability and Change<br>“Much of science and mathematics has to do with understanding how change <br>occurs in nature and in social and technological systems, and much of technol-<br>ogy has to do with creating and controlling change,” according to the American <br>Association for the Advancement of Science. “Constancy, often in the midst of <br>change, is also the subject of intense study in science” [4]. <br>Stability denotes a condition in which some aspects of a system are unchang-<br></span><span style="background-color: #FDFFB6;" title="Chunk 114 | Start: 257318 | End: 259482 | Tokens: 499">ing, at least at the scale of observation. Stability means that a small disturbance <br>will fade away—that is, the system will stay in, or return to, the stable condition. <br>Such stability can take different forms, with the simplest being a static equilib-<br>rium, such as a ladder leaning on a wall. By contrast, a system with steady inflows <br>and outflows (i.e., constant conditions) is said to be in dynamic equilibrium. For <br>example, a dam may be at a constant level with steady quantities of water com-<br>ing in and out. Increase the inflow, and a new equilibrium level will eventually be <br>reached if the outflow increases as well. At extreme flows, other factors may cause <br>disequilibrium; for example, at a low-enough inflow, evaporation may cause the <br>level of the water to continually drop. Likewise, a fluid at a constant temperature <br>can be in a steady state with constant chemical composition even though chemi-<br>cal reactions that change the composition in two opposite directions are occurring <br>within it; change the temperature and it will reach a new steady state with a dif-<br>ferent composition.<br>A repeating pattern of cyclic change—such as the moon orbiting Earth—can <br>also be seen as a stable situation, even though it is clearly not static. Such a system <br>has constant aspects, however, such as the distance from Earth to the moon, the <br>period of its orbit, and the pattern of phases seen over time. <br>In designing systems for stable operation, the mechanisms of external con-<br>trols and internal “feedback” loops are important design elements; feedback is <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

A feedback loop is any mech-<br>anism in which a condition triggers some action that causes a change in that same <br>condition, such as the temperature of a room triggering the thermostatic control <br>that turns the room’s heater on or off. Feedback can stabilize a system (negative <br>feedback—a thermostat in a cooling room triggers heating, but only until a par-<br></span><span style="background-color: #CAFFBF;" title="Chunk 115 | Start: 259482 | End: 261740 | Tokens: 504">ticular temperature range is reached) or destabilize a system (positive feedback—a <br>fire releases heat, which triggers the burning of more fuel, which causes the fire to <br>continue to grow). <br>A system can be stable on a small time scale, but on a larger time scale it <br>may be seen to be changing. For example, when looking at a living organism over <br>the course of an hour or a day, it may maintain stability; over longer periods, the <br>organism grows, ages, and eventually dies. For the development of larger systems, <br>such as the variety of living species inhabiting Earth or the formation of a galaxy, <br>the relevant time scales may be very long indeed; such processes occur over mil-<br>lions or even billions of years. <br>When studying a system’s patterns of change over time, it is also important <br>to examine what is unchanging. Understanding the feedback mechanisms that <br>regulate the system’s stability or that drive its instability provides insight into <br>how the system may operate under various conditions. These mechanisms are <br>important to evaluate when comparing different design options that address a <br>particular problem. <br>Any system has a range of conditions under which it can operate in a stable <br>fashion, as well as conditions under which it cannot function. For example, a par-<br>ticular living organism can survive only within a certain range of temperatures, <br>and outside that span it will die. Thus elucidating what range of conditions can <br>lead to a system’s stable operation and what changes would destabilize it (and in <br>what ways) is an important goal. <br>Note that stability is always a balance of competing effects; a small change <br>in conditions or in a single component of the system can lead to runaway changes <br>in the system if compensatory mechanisms are absent. Nevertheless, students typi-<br>cally begin with an idea of equilibrium as a static situation, and they interpret a <br>lack of change in the system as an indication that nothing is happening. Thus they <br>need guidance to begin to appreciate that stability can be the result of multiple <br>opposing forces; they should be taught to identify the invisible forces—to appreci-<br>ate the dynamic equilibrium—in a seemingly static situation, even one as simple as <br>a book lying on a table. <br></span><span style="background-color: #9BF6FF;" title="Chunk 116 | Start: 261740 | End: 264046 | Tokens: 499"><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Dynamic equilibrium is an equally important concept <br>for understanding the physical forces in matter. Stable matter is a system of atoms <br>in dynamic equilibrium.<br>For example, the stability of the book lying on the table depends on the fact <br>that minute distortions of the table caused by the book’s downward push on the <br>table in turn cause changes in the positions of the table’s atoms. These changes <br>then alter the forces between those atoms, which lead to changes in the upward <br>force on the book exerted by the table. The book continues to distort the table <br>until the table’s upward force on the book exactly balances the downward pull of <br>gravity on the book. Place a heavy enough item on the table, however, and stabil-<br>ity is not possible; the distortions of matter within the table continue to the mac-<br>roscopic scale, and it collapses under the weight. Such seemingly simple, explicit, <br>and visible examples of how change in some factor produces changes in the sys-<br>tem can help to establish a mental model of dynamic equilibrium useful for think-<br>ing about more complex systems. <br>Understanding long-term changes—for example, the evolution of the diver-<br>sity of species, the surface of Earth, or the structure of the universe—requires a <br>sense of the requisite time scales for such changes to develop. Long time scales <br>can be difficult for students to grasp, however. Part of their understanding should <br>grow from an appreciation of how scientists investigate the nature of these <br>processes—through the interplay of evidence and system modeling. Student-<br>developed models that use comparative time scales can also be helpful; for exam-<br>ple, if the history of Earth is scaled to 1 year (instead of the absolute measures in <br>eons), students gain a more intuitive understanding of the relative durations of <br>periods in the planet’s evolution.<br></span><span style="background-color: #A0C4FF;" title="Chunk 117 | Start: 264046 | End: 266292 | Tokens: 502">Progression<br>Even very young children begin to explore stability (as they build objects with <br>blocks or climb on a wall) and change (as they note their own growth or that <br>of a plant).

Examining these questions in different contexts (e.g., a model ecosystem <br>such as a terrarium, the local weather, a design for a bridge) broadens students’ <br>understanding that stability and change are related and that a good model for a <br>system must be able to offer explanations for both. <br>In middle school, as student’s understanding of matter progresses to the <br>atomic scale, so too should their models and their explanations of stability and <br>change.

Students at this level should <br>also recognize that much of science deals with constructing historical explanations <br>of how things evolved to be the way they are today, which involves modeling rates <br>of change and conditions under which the system is stable or changes gradually, as <br>well as explanations of any sudden change. <br>INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN CROSSCUTTING CONCEPTS  <br>AND DISCIPLINARY CORE IDEAS<br>Students’ understanding of these crosscutting concepts should be reinforced by <br></span><span style="background-color: #BDB2FF;" title="Chunk 118 | Start: 266292 | End: 268159 | Tokens: 510">repeated use of them in the context of instruction in the disciplinary core ideas <br>presented in Chapters 5-8. In turn, the crosscutting concepts can provide a con-<br>nective structure that supports students’ understanding of sciences as disciplines <br>and that facilitates students’ comprehension of the phenomena under study in <br>particular disciplines. Thus these crosscutting concepts should not be taught in <br>isolation from the examples provided in the disciplinary context. Moreover, use of <br>a common language for these concepts across disciplines will help students to rec-<br>ognize that the same concept is relevant across different contexts. <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Large-scale systems often have emergent properties that cannot be explained <br>on the basis of atomic-scale processes; nevertheless, to understand the physical and <br>chemical basis of a system, one must ultimately consider the structure of matter at <br>the atomic and subatomic scales to discover how it influences the system’s larger <br>scale structures, properties, and functions. Similarly, understanding a process at <br>any scale requires awareness of the interactions occurring—in terms of the forces <br>between objects, the related energy transfers, and their consequences. In this way, <br>the physical sciences—physics and chemistry—underlie all natural and human-<br>created phenomena, although other kinds of information transfers, such as those <br>facilitated by the genetic code or communicated between organisms, may also be <br>critical to understanding their behavior. An overarching goal for learning in the <br>physical sciences, therefore, is to help students see that there are mechanisms of <br>cause and effect in all systems and processes that can be understood through a <br>common set of physical and chemical principles.<br>The committee developed four core ideas in the physical sciences—three <br>of which parallel those identified in previous documents, including the National <br>Science Education Standards and Benchmarks for Science Literacy [1, 2].

This idea is included in recognition of <br>the fact that organizing science instruction around disciplinary core ideas tends to <br>leave out the applications of those ideas. The committee included this fourth idea <br>to stress the interplay of physical science and technology, as well as to expand <br>students’ understanding of light and sound as mechanisms of both energy trans-<br>fer (see LS3) and transfer of information between objects that are not in contact. <br>Modern communication, information, and imaging technologies are applications <br>of scientific understandings of light and sound and their interactions with mat-<br>ter. They are pervasive in our lives today and are also critical tools without which <br>much of modern science could not be done. See Box 5-1 for a summary of these <br>four core ideas and their components.<br>The first three physical science core ideas answer two fundamental <br>questions—“What is everything made of?” and “Why do things happen?”—<br>that are not unlike questions that students themselves might ask. These core <br>ideas can be applied to explain and predict a wide variety of phenomena that <br>occur in people’s everyday lives, such as the evaporation of a puddle of water, <br>the transmission of sound, the digital storage and transmission of information, <br>the tarnishing of metals, and photosynthesis. And because such explanations <br>and predictions rely on a basic understanding of matter and energy, students’ <br>abilities to conceive of the interactions of matter and energy are central to their <br>science education. <br>The historical division between the two subjects of physics and chemistry is <br>transcended in modern science, as the same physical principles are seen to apply <br>from subatomic scales to the scale of the universe itself. For this reason we have <br>chosen to present the two subjects together, thereby ensuring a more coherent <br>approach to the core ideas across all grades. The designation of physical science <br>courses at the high school level as either physics or chemistry is not precluded by <br>our grouping of these disciplines; what is important is that all students are offered <br>a course sequence that gives them the opportunity and support to learn about all <br>these ideas and to recognize the connections between them.<br></span><span style="background-color: #FFD6A5;" title="Chunk 121 | Start: 272795 | End: 274821 | Tokens: 510"><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Matter can be understood in terms of the types <br>of atoms present and the interactions both between and within them. The states <br>(i.e., solid, liquid, gas, or plasma), properties (e.g., hardness, conductivity), and <br>reactions (both physical and chemical) of matter can be described and predicted <br>based on the types, interactions, and motions of the atoms within it.

Nuclear reactions involve changes in the types of <br>atomic nuclei present and are key to the energy release from the sun and the bal-<br>ance of isotopes in matter. <br>PS1.A: STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF MATTER<br>How do particles combine to form the variety of matter one observes?<br>While too small to be seen with visible light, atoms have substructures of their <br>own. They have a small central region or nucleus—containing protons and <br>neutrons—surrounded by a larger region containing electrons. The number of pro-<br>tons in the atomic nucleus (atomic number) is the defining characteristic of each <br>element; different isotopes of the same element differ in the number of neutrons <br>only. Despite the immense variation and number of substances, there are only <br>some 100 different stable elements.<br>Each element has characteristic chemical properties. The periodic table, a <br>systematic representation of known elements, is organized horizontally by increas-<br>ing atomic number and vertically by families of elements with related chemical <br>properties. The development of the periodic table (which occurred well before <br>atomic substructure was understood) was a major advance, as its patterns sug-<br>gested and led to the identification of additional elements with particular proper-<br>ties. Moreover, the table’s patterns are now recognized as related to the atom’s <br>outermost electron patterns, which play an important role in explaining chemical <br>reactivity and bond formation, and the periodic table continues to be a useful way <br>to organize this information.<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Electrical attractions and repulsions between <br>charged particles (i.e., atomic nuclei and electrons) in matter explain the struc-<br>ture of atoms and the forces between atoms that cause them to form molecules <br>(via chemical bonds), which range in size from two to thousands of atoms (e.g., <br></span><span style="background-color: #CAFFBF;" title="Chunk 123 | Start: 277080 | End: 279193 | Tokens: 503">in biological molecules such as proteins). Atoms also combine due to these forces <br>to form extended structures, <br>such as crystals or metals. <br>The varied properties (e.g., <br>hardness, conductivity) of <br>the materials one encounters, <br>both natural and manufac-<br>tured, can be understood <br>in terms of the atomic and <br>molecular constituents pres-<br>ent and the forces within and <br>between them. <br>Within matter, atoms <br>and their constituents are <br>constantly in motion. The <br>arrangement and motion of <br>atoms vary in characteristic <br>ways, depending on the sub-<br>stance and its current state <br>(e.g., solid, liquid). Chemical composition, temperature, and pressure affect such <br>arrangements and motions of atoms, as well as the ways in which they interact. <br>Under a given set of conditions, the state and some properties (e.g., density, <br>elasticity, viscosity) are the same for different bulk quantities of a substance, <br>whereas other properties (e.g., volume, mass) provide measures of the size of the <br>sample at hand.<br>Materials can be characterized by their intensive measureable properties. <br>Different materials with different properties are suited to different uses. The ability <br>to image and manipulate placement of individual atoms in tiny structures allows <br>for the design of new types of materials with particular desired functionality (e.g., <br>plastics, nanoparticles). Moreover, the modern explanation of how particular <br>atoms influence the properties of materials or molecules is critical to understand-<br>ing the physical and chemical functioning of biological systems. <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Different properties are suited to different purposes. A great variety of <br>objects can be built up from a small set of pieces (e.g., blocks, construction <br>sets). Objects or samples of a substance can be weighed, and their size can <br>be described and measured. (Boundary: volume is introduced only for liquid <br>measure.)<br>By the end of grade 5. Matter of any type can be subdivided into particles that <br>are too small to see, but even then the matter still exists and can be detected by <br>other means (e.g., by weighing or by its effects on other objects). For example, <br>a model showing that gases are made from matter particles that are too small <br>to see and are moving freely around in space can explain many observations, <br>including the inflation and shape of a balloon; the effects of air on larger par-<br>ticles or objects (e.g., leaves in wind, dust suspended in air); and the appearance <br>of visible scale water droplets in condensation, fog, and, by extension, also in <br>clouds or the contrails of a jet. The amount (weight) of matter is conserved <br>when it changes form, even in transitions in which it seems to vanish (e.g., sugar <br>in solution, evaporation in a closed container). Measurements of a variety of <br>properties (e.g., hardness, reflectivity) can be used to identify particular materi-<br>als. (Boundary: At this grade level, mass and weight are not distinguished, and <br>no attempt is made to define the unseen particles or explain the atomic-scale <br>mechanism of evaporation and condensation.)<br>By the end of grade 8. All substances are made from some 100 different types of <br>atoms, which combine with one another in various ways. Atoms form molecules <br>that range in size from two to thousands of atoms. Pure substances are made from <br>a single type of atom or molecule; each pure substance has characteristic physical <br>and chemical properties (for any bulk quantity under given conditions) that can be <br>used to identify it.<br>Gases and liquids are made of molecules or inert atoms that are moving <br>about relative to each other.

Solids may be formed from molecules, or they may be <br>extended structures with repeating subunits (e.g., crystals). The changes of state <br>that occur with variations in temperature or pressure can be described and pre-<br>dicted using these models of matter. (Boundary: Predictions here are qualitative, <br>not quantitative.)<br>By the end of grade 12. Each atom has a charged substructure consisting of a <br>nucleus, which is made of protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons. The <br>periodic table orders elements horizontally by the number of protons in the atom’s <br>nucleus and places those with similar chemical properties in columns. The repeat-<br>ing patterns of this table reflect patterns of outer electron states. The structure <br>and interactions of matter at the bulk scale are determined by electrical forces <br>within and between atoms. Stable forms of matter are those in which the electric <br>and magnetic field energy is minimized. A stable molecule has less energy, by an <br>amount known as the binding energy, than the same set of atoms separated; one <br>must provide at least this energy in order to take the molecule apart.<br>PS1.B: CHEMICAL REACTIONS<br>How do substances combine or change (react) to make new substances? How does <br>one characterize and explain these reactions and make predictions about them?<br>Many substances react chemically with other substances to form new substances <br>with different properties. This change in properties results from the ways in which <br>atoms from the original substances are combined and rearranged in the new sub-<br>stances. However, the total number of each type of atom is conserved (does not <br>change) in any chemical process, and thus mass does not change either. The prop-<br>erty of conservation can be used, along with knowledge of the chemical properties <br>of particular elements, to describe and predict the outcomes of reactions.

Such changes are generally easier to reverse (return to original <br>conditions) than chemical changes.<br>“Collision theory” provides a qualitative model for explaining the rates of <br>chemical reactions. Higher rates occur at higher temperatures because atoms are <br>typically moving faster and thus collisions are more frequent; also, a larger frac-<br>tion of the collisions have sufficient energy to initiate the process. Although a <br>solution or a gas may have constant chemical composition—that is, be in a steady <br>state—chemical reactions may be occurring within it that are dynamically bal-<br>anced with reactions in opposite directions proceeding at equal rates. <br>Any chemical process involves a change in chemical bonds and the related <br>bond energies and thus in the total chemical binding energy. This change is <br>matched by a difference between the total kinetic energy of the set of reactant <br>molecules before the collision and that of the set of product molecules after the <br>collision (conservation of energy). Some reactions release energy (e.g., burning fuel <br>in the presence of oxygen), and others require energy input (e.g., synthesis of sug-<br>ars from carbon dioxide and water).<br>Understanding chemical reactions and the properties of elements is essential <br>not only to the physical sciences but also is foundational knowledge for the life <br>sciences and the earth and space sciences. The cycling of matter and associated <br>transfers of energy in systems, of any scale, depend on physical and chemical pro-<br>cesses.

Substances react chemically in characteristic ways. In a <br>chemical process, the atoms that make up the original substances are regrouped <br>into different molecules, and these new substances have different properties from <br>those of the reactants.

In many situations, a dynamic and <br>condition-dependent balance between a reaction and the reverse reaction deter-<br>mines the numbers of all types of molecules present. <br>The fact that atoms are conserved, together with knowledge of the chemical <br>properties of the elements involved, can be used to describe and predict chemical <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFADAD;" title="Chunk 128 | Start: 288134 | End: 290473 | Tokens: 507">reactions.

To explain and pre-<br>dict nuclear processes, two additional types of interactions—known as strong and <br>weak nuclear interactions—must be introduced. They play a fundamental role in <br>nuclei, although not at larger scales because their effects are very short range.<br>The strong nuclear interaction provides the primary force that holds nuclei <br>together and determines nuclear binding energies. Without it, the electromagnetic <br>forces between protons would make all nuclei other than hydrogen unstable. <br>Nuclear processes mediated by these interactions include fusion, fission, and the <br>radioactive decays of unstable nuclei. These processes involve changes in nuclear <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>112<br>binding energies and masses (as described by E = mc2), and typically they release <br>much more energy per atom involved than do chemical processes. <br>Nuclear fusion is a process in which a collision of two small nuclei eventu-<br>ally results in the formation of a single more massive nucleus with greater net <br>binding energy and hence a release of energy. It occurs only under conditions of <br>extremely high temperature and pressure. Nuclear fusion occurring in the cores <br>of stars provides the energy released (as light) from those stars. The Big Bang <br>produced matter in the form of hydrogen and smaller amounts of helium and <br>lithium. Over time, stars (including supernova explosions) have produced and <br>dispersed all the more massive atoms, starting from primordial low-mass ele-<br>ments, chiefly hydrogen. <br>Nuclear fission is a process in which a massive nucleus splits into two or <br>more smaller nuclei, which fly apart at high energy. The produced nuclei are often <br>not stable and undergo subsequent radioactive decays. A common fission fragment <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFD6A5;" title="Chunk 129 | Start: 290473 | End: 292655 | Tokens: 508">is an alpha particle, which is just another name for a helium nucleus, given before <br>this type of “radiation” was identified.<br>In addition to alpha particles, other types of radioactive decays produce <br>other forms of radiation, originally labeled as “beta” and “gamma” particles and <br>now recognized as electrons or positrons, and photons (i.e., high-frequency elec-<br>tromagnetic radiation), respectively. Because of the high-energy release in nuclear <br>transitions, the emitted radiation (whether it be alpha, beta, or gamma type) can <br>ionize atoms and may thereby cause damage to biological tissue. <br>Nuclear fission and radioactive decays limit the set of stable isotopes of ele-<br>ments and the size of the largest stable nucleus. Spontaneous radioactive decays <br>follow a characteristic exponential decay law, with a specific lifetime (time scale) <br>for each such process; the lifetimes of different nuclear decay processes range from <br>fractions of a second to thousands of years. Some unstable but long-lived isotopes <br>are present in rocks and minerals. Knowledge of their nuclear lifetimes allows <br>radiometric dating to be used to determine the ages of rocks and other materials <br>from the isotope ratios present. <br>In fission, fusion, and beta decay processes, atoms change type, but the total <br>number of protons plus neutrons is conserved. Beta processes involve an addition-<br>al type of interaction (the weak interaction) that can change neutrons into protons <br>or vice versa, along with the emission or absorption of electrons or positrons and <br>of neutrinos. Isolated neutrons decay by this process.<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Nuclear fusion taking place in the cores of stars pro-<br>vides the energy released (as light) from those stars and produced all of the more <br>massive atoms from primordial hydrogen.

All forces between objects arise from a few types of interactions: grav-<br>ity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear interactions. <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>114<br>PS2.A: FORCES AND MOTION<br>How can one predict an object’s continued motion, changes in motion, or stability?<br>Interactions of an object with another object can be explained and predicted <br>using the concept of forces, which can cause a change in motion of one or both <br>of the interacting objects. An individual force acts on one particular object and is <br></span><span style="background-color: #CAFFBF;" title="Chunk 131 | Start: 295006 | End: 297142 | Tokens: 504">described by its strength and direction. <br>The strengths of forces can be measured <br>and their values compared. <br>What happens when a force is <br>applied to an object depends not only <br>on that force but also on all the other <br>forces acting on that object. A static <br>object typically has multiple forces act-<br>ing on it, but they sum to zero. If the <br>total (vector sum) force on an object <br>is not zero, however, its motion will <br>change. Sometimes forces on an object <br>can also change its shape or orienta-<br>tion. For any pair of interacting objects, <br>the force exerted by the first object on the second object is equal in strength to <br>the force that the second object exerts on the first but in the opposite direction <br>(Newton’s third law). <br>At the macroscale, the motion of an object subject to forces is governed by <br>Newton’s second law of motion. Under everyday circumstances, the mathematical <br>expression of this law in the form F = ma (total force = mass times acceleration) <br>accurately predicts changes in the motion of a single macroscopic object of a given <br>mass due to the total force on it.

For macroscopic objects, any such pro-<br>cess (e.g., collisions, sliding contact) also transfers some of the energy to the sur-<br>rounding air by sound or heat. For molecules, collisions can also result in energy <br>transfers through chemical processes, which increase or decrease the total amount <br>of stored energy within a system of atoms; the change in stored energy is always <br>balanced by a change in total kinetic energy—that of the molecules present after <br>the process compared with the kinetic energy of the molecules present before it. <br>Energy can also be transferred from place to place by electric currents. <br>Heating is another process for transferring energy.

However, prior <br>motion and other forces also affect the actual direction of motion. <br>Patterns of motion, such as a weight bobbing on a spring or a swinging <br>pendulum, can be understood in terms of forces at each instant or in terms of <br>transformation of energy between the motion and one or more forms of stored <br>energy. Elastic collisions between two objects can be modeled at the macro-<br>scopic scale using conservation of energy without having to examine the detailed <br>microscopic forces. <br>Grade Band Endpoints for PS3.C<br>By the end of grade 2. A bigger push or pull makes things go faster. Faster speeds <br>during a collision can cause a bigger change in shape of the colliding objects.<br>By the end of grade 5. When objects collide, the contact forces transfer energy so <br>as to change the objects’ motions. Magnets can exert forces on other magnets or <br>on magnetizable materials, causing energy transfer between them (e.g., leading to <br>changes in motion) even when the objects are not touching. <br>By the end of grade 8. When two objects interact, each one exerts a force on the <br>other that can cause energy to be transferred to or from the object. For example, <br>when energy is transferred to an Earth-object system as an object is raised, the <br>gravitational field energy of the system increases. This energy is released as the <br>object falls; the mechanism of this release is the gravitational force. Likewise, two <br>magnetic and electrically charged objects interacting at a distance exert forces on <br>each other that can transfer energy between the interacting objects.<br>By the end of grade 12. Force fields (gravitational, electric, and magnetic) contain <br>energy and can transmit energy across space from one object to another. <br>When two objects interacting through a force field change relative position, <br>the energy stored in the force field is changed. Each force between the two inter-<br>acting objects acts in the direction such that motion in that direction would reduce <br>the energy in the force field between the objects.

This refers <br>to the fact that energy in concentrated form is useful for generating electricity, <br>moving or heating objects, and producing light, whereas diffuse energy in the envi-<br>ronment is not readily captured for practical use. Therefore, to produce energy <br>typically means to convert some stored energy into a desired form—for example, <br>the stored energy of water behind a dam is released as the water flows downhill <br>and drives a turbine generator to produce electricity, which is then delivered to <br>users through distribution systems. Food, fuel, and batteries are especially conve-<br>nient energy resources because they can be moved from place to place to provide <br>processes that release energy where needed. A system does not destroy energy <br>when carrying out any process. However, the process cannot occur without energy <br>being available. The energy is also not destroyed by the end of the process. Most <br>often some or all of it has been transferred to heat the surrounding environment; <br>in the same sense that paper is not destroyed when it is written on, it still exists <br>but is not readily available for further use. <br>Naturally occurring food and fuel contain complex carbon-based mole-<br>cules, chiefly derived from plant matter that has been formed by photosynthesis. <br>The chemical reaction of these molecules with oxygen releases energy; such reac-<br>tions provide energy for most animal life and for residential, commercial, and <br>industrial activities.<br>Electric power generation is based on fossil fuels (i.e., coal, oil, and natural <br>gas), nuclear fission, or renewable resources (e.g., solar, wind, tidal, geothermal, <br>and hydro power).

Life is self-contained, self-sustaining, self-replicating, and evolv-<br>ing, operating according to laws of the physical world, as well as genetic <br>programming. Life scientists use observations, experiments, hypotheses, tests, <br>models, theory, and technology to explore how life works. The study of life ranges <br>over scales from single molecules, through organisms and ecosystems, to the <br>entire biosphere, that is all life on Earth. It examines processes that occur on time <br>scales from the blink of an eye to those that happen over billions of years. Living <br>systems are interconnected and interacting. Although living organisms respond <br>to the physical environment or geosphere, they have also fundamentally changed <br>Earth over evolutionary time. Rapid advances in life sciences are helping to pro-<br>vide biological solutions to societal problems related to food, energy, health, and <br>environment. <br>From viruses and bacteria to plants to fungi to animals, the diversity of <br>the millions of life forms on Earth is astonishing. Without unifying principles, it <br>would be difficult to make sense of the living world and apply those understand-<br>ings to solving problems. A core principle of the life sciences is that all organ-<br>isms are related by evolution and that evolutionary processes have led to the <br>tremendous diversity of the biosphere. There is diversity within species as well as <br>between species. Yet what is learned about the function of a gene or a cell or a <br>process in one organism is relevant to other organisms because of their ecologi-<br>cal interactions and evolutionary relatedness.

These core ideas are essential for a conceptual understanding of the <br>life sciences and will enable students to make sense of emerging research findings. <br>We begin at the level of organisms, delving into the many processes and struc-<br>tures, at scales ranging from components as small as individual atoms to organ <br>systems that are necessary for life to be sustained. Our focus then broadens to <br>consider organisms in their environment—how they interact with the environ-<br>ment’s living (biotic) and physical (abiotic) features. Next the chapter considers <br>how organisms reproduce, passing genetic information to their offspring, and <br>how these mechanisms lead to variability and hence diversity within species. <br>Finally, the core ideas in the life sciences culminate with the principle that evolu-<br>tion can explain how the diversity that is observed within species has led to the <br>diversity of life across species through a process of descent with adaptive modifi-<br>cation. Evolution also accounts for the remarkable similarity of the fundamental <br>characteristics of all species. <br>The first core idea, LS1: From Molecules to Organisms: Structures and <br>Processes, addresses how individual organisms are configured and how these <br>structures function to support life, growth, behavior, and reproduction. The first <br>core idea hinges on the unifying principle that cells are the basic unit of life.<br>The second core idea, LS2: Ecosystems: Interactions, Energy, and Dynamics, <br>explores organisms’ interactions with each other and their physical environment. <br>This includes how organisms obtain resources, how they change their environ-<br>ment, how changing environmental factors affect organisms and ecosystems, how <br>social interactions and group behavior play out within and between species, and <br>how these factors all combine to determine ecosystem functioning. <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFADAD;" title="Chunk 160 | Start: 359246 | End: 361566 | Tokens: 510">The third core idea, LS3: Heredity: Inheritance and Variation of Traits <br>across generations, focuses on the flow of genetic information between genera-<br>tions. This idea explains the mechanisms of genetic inheritance and describes <br>the environmental and genetic causes of gene mutation and the alteration of <br>gene expression. <br>The fourth core idea, LS4: Biological Evolution: Unity and Diversity, <br>explores “changes in the traits of populations of organisms over time” [1] <br>and the factors that account for species’ unity and diversity alike.

It describes how variation of genetically deter-<br>mined traits in a population may give some members a reproductive advantage <br>in a given environment. This natural selection can lead to adaptation, that is, to <br>a distribution of traits in the population that is matched to and can change with <br>environmental conditions. Such adaptations can eventually lead to the develop-<br>ment of separate species in separated populations. Finally, the idea describes the <br>factors, including human activity, that affect biodiversity in an ecosystem, and <br>the value of biodiversity in ecosystem resilience. See Box 6-1 for a summary of <br>these four core ideas and their components. <br>These four core ideas, which represent basic life sciences fields of <br>investigation—structures and processes in organisms, ecology, heredity, and <br>evolution—have a long history and solid foundation based on the research evi-<br>dence established by many scientists working across multiple fields. The role <br>of unifying principles in advancing modern life sciences is articulated in The <br>Role of Theory in Advancing 21st-Century Biology and A New Biology for the <br>21st Century [2, 3]. In developing these core ideas, the committee also drew on <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFD6A5;" title="Chunk 161 | Start: 361566 | End: 363459 | Tokens: 492">the established K-12 science education literature, including National Science <br>Education Standards and Benchmarks for Science Literacy [4, 5]. The ideas <br>also incorporate contemporary documents, such as the Science College Board <br>Standards for College Success [6], and the ideas are consistent with frame-<br>works for national and international assessments, such as those of the National <br>Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), the Programme for International <br>Student Assessment (PISA), and the Trends in International Mathematics and <br>Science Study (TIMSS) [7-9]. Furthermore, the ideas align with the core concepts <br>for biological literacy for undergraduates to build on as described in the American <br>Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) report Vision and Change in <br>Undergraduate Biology Education [10]. <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Life is the quality that distinguishes living <br>things—composed of living cells—from nonliving objects or those that have died. <br>While a simple definition of life can be difficult to capture, all living things—that <br>is to say all organisms—can be characterized by common aspects of their structure <br>and functioning. Organisms are complex, organized, and built on a hierarchical <br>structure, with each level providing the foundation for the next, from the chemical <br>foundation of elements and atoms, to the cells and systems of individual organ-<br>isms, to species and populations living and interacting in complex ecosystems. <br>Organisms can be made of a single cell or millions of cells working together and <br>include animals, plants, algae, fungi, bacteria, and all other microorganisms. <br>Organisms respond to stimuli from their environment and actively maintain <br>their internal environment through homeostasis. They grow and reproduce, trans-<br>ferring their genetic information to their offspring. While individual organisms <br>carry the same genetic information over their lifetime, mutation and the transfer <br>from parent to offspring produce new combinations of genes. Over generations <br>natural selection can lead to changes in a species overall; hence, species evolve <br>over time. To maintain all of these processes and functions, organisms require <br>materials and energy from their environment; nearly all energy that sustains life <br>ultimately comes from the sun.<br>LS1.A: STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION<br>How do the structures of organisms enable life’s functions?<br>A central feature of life is that organisms grow, reproduce, and <br>die. They have characteristic structures (anatomy and morphol-<br>ogy), functions (molecular-scale processes to organism-level <br>physiology), and behaviors (neurobiology and, for some animal <br>species, psychology). Organisms and their parts are made of <br>cells, which are the structural units of life and which themselves <br></span><span style="background-color: #CAFFBF;" title="Chunk 163 | Start: 365789 | End: 368002 | Tokens: 495">have molecular substructures that support their functioning. <br>Organisms range in composition from a single cell (unicellular <br>microorganisms) to multicellular organisms, in which different <br>groups of large numbers of cells work together to form systems <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

The essential functions of a cell involve chemical reactions between many <br>types of molecules, including water, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic <br>acids. All cells contain genetic information, in the form of DNA. Genes are specif-<br>ic regions within the extremely large DNA molecules that form the chromosomes. <br>Genes contain the instructions that code for the formation of molecules called pro-<br>teins, which carry out most of the work of cells to perform the essential functions <br>of life. That is, proteins provide structural components, serve as signaling devices, <br>regulate cell activities, and determine the performance of cells through their enzy-<br>matic actions.<br>Grade Band Endpoints for LS1.A<br>By the end of grade 2. All organisms have external parts. Different animals use <br>their body parts in different ways to see, hear, grasp objects, protect themselves, <br>move from place to place, and seek, find, and take in food, water and air. Plants <br>also have different parts (roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits) that help them sur-<br>vive, grow, and produce more plants.<br>By the end of grade 5. Plants and animals have both internal and external struc-<br>tures that serve various functions in growth, survival, behavior, and reproduction. <br>(Boundary: Stress at this grade level is on understanding the macroscale systems <br>and their function, not microscopic processes.)<br>By the end of grade 8. All living things are made up of cells, which is the smallest <br>unit that can be said to be alive. An organism may consist of one single cell (uni-<br></span><span style="background-color: #9BF6FF;" title="Chunk 164 | Start: 368002 | End: 370317 | Tokens: 508">cellular) or many different numbers and types of cells (multicellular). Unicellular <br>organisms (microorganisms), like multicellular organisms, need food, water, a way <br>to dispose of waste, and an environment in which they can live. <br>Within cells, special structures are responsible for particular functions, and <br>the cell membrane forms the boundary that controls what enters and leaves the <br>cell. In multicellular organisms, the body is a system of multiple interacting sub-<br>systems. These subsystems are groups of cells that work together to form tissues <br>or organs that are specialized for particular body functions. (Boundary: At this <br>grade level, only a few major cell structures should be introduced.)<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Systems of specialized cells within organisms help them <br>perform the essential functions of life, which involve chemical reactions that take <br>place between different types of molecules, such as water, proteins, carbohydrates, <br>lipids, and nucleic acids. All cells contain genetic information in the form of DNA <br>molecules. Genes are regions in the DNA that contain the instructions that code <br>for the formation of proteins, which carry out most of the work of cells. <br>Multicellular organisms have a hierarchical structural organization, in which <br>any one system is made up of numerous parts and is itself a component of the <br>next level. Feedback mechanisms maintain a living system’s internal conditions <br>within certain limits and mediate behaviors, allowing it to remain alive and func-<br>tional even as external conditions change within some range. Outside that range <br>(e.g., at a too high or too low external temperature, with too little food or water <br>available), the organism cannot survive. Feedback mechanisms can encourage <br>(through positive feedback) or discourage (negative feedback) what is going on <br>inside the living system.<br>LS1.B: GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF ORGANISMS<br>How do organisms grow and develop?<br>The characteristic structures, functions, and behaviors of organisms change in <br>predictable ways as they progress from birth to old age. For example, upon reach-<br></span><span style="background-color: #A0C4FF;" title="Chunk 165 | Start: 370317 | End: 372687 | Tokens: 505">ing adulthood, organisms can reproduce and transfer their genetic information to <br>their offspring. Animals engage in behaviors that increase their chances for repro-<br>duction, and plants may develop specialized structures and/or depend on animal <br>behavior to accomplish reproduction.<br>Understanding how a single cell can give rise to a complex, multicellular <br>organism builds on the concepts of cell division and gene expression. In multi-<br>cellular organisms, cell division is an essential component of growth, development, <br>and repair. Cell division occurs via a process called mitosis: when a cell divides in <br>two, it passes identical genetic material to two daughter cells. Successive divisions <br>produce many cells. Although the genetic material in each of the cells is identical, <br>small differences in the immediate environments activate or inactivate different <br>genes, which can cause the cells to develop slightly differently. This process of <br>differentiation allows the body to form specialized cells that perform diverse func-<br>tions, even though they are all descended from a single cell, the fertilized egg. Cell <br>growth and differentiation are the mechanisms by which a fertilized egg develops <br>into a complex organism. In sexual reproduction, a specialized type of cell division <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Plants and animals have predictable characteristics at dif-<br>ferent stages of development. Plants and animals grow and change. Adult plants <br>and animals can have young. In many kinds of animals, parents and the offspring <br>themselves engage in behaviors that help the offspring to survive.<br>By the end of grade 5. Reproduction is essential to the continued existence of <br>every kind of organism. Plants and animals have unique and diverse life cycles <br>that include being born (sprouting in plants), growing, developing into adults, <br>reproducing, and eventually dying. <br>By the end of grade 8. Organisms reproduce, either sexually or asexually, and <br></span><span style="background-color: #BDB2FF;" title="Chunk 166 | Start: 372687 | End: 374892 | Tokens: 495">transfer their genetic information to their offspring. Animals engage in characteris-<br>tic behaviors that increase the odds of reproduction. Plants reproduce in a variety <br>of ways, sometimes depending on animal <br>behavior and specialized features (such as <br>attractively colored flowers) for reproduc-<br>tion. Plant growth can continue throughout <br>the plant’s life through production of plant <br>matter in photosynthesis. Genetic factors <br>as well as local conditions affect the size of <br>the adult plant. The growth of an animal is <br>controlled by genetic factors, food intake, <br>and interactions with other organisms, and <br>each species has a typical adult size range. <br>(Boundary: Reproduction is not treated in <br>any detail here; for more specifics about <br>grade level, see LS3.A.)	<br>By the end of grade 12. In multicellular organisms individual cells grow and then <br>divide via a process called mitosis, thereby allowing the organism to grow. The <br>organism begins as a single cell (fertilized egg) that divides successively to produce <br>many cells, with each parent cell passing identical genetic material (two variants <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

As successive subdivisions of <br>an embryo’s cells occur, programmed genetic instructions and small differences <br>in their immediate environments activate or inactivate different genes, which <br>cause the cells to develop differently—a process called differentiation. Cellular <br>division and differentiation produce and maintain a complex organism, com-<br>posed of systems of tissues and organs that work together to meet the needs of <br>the whole organism. In sexual reproduction, a specialized type of cell division <br>called meiosis occurs that results in the production of sex cells, such as gametes <br>in animals (sperm and eggs), which contain only one member from each chro-<br>mosome pair in the parent cell.<br>LS1.C: ORGANIZATION FOR MATTER AND ENERGY FLOW IN ORGANISMS<br>How do organisms obtain and use the matter and energy they need to live and grow?<br></span><span style="background-color: #FFC6FF;" title="Chunk 167 | Start: 374892 | End: 377147 | Tokens: 506">Sustaining life requires substantial energy and matter inputs. The complex struc-<br>tural organization of organisms accommodates the capture, transformation, trans-<br>port, release, and elimination of the matter and energy needed to sustain them. <br>As matter and energy flow through different organizational levels—cells, tissues, <br>organs, organisms, populations, communities, and ecosystems—of living systems, <br>chemical elements are recombined in different ways to form different products. <br>The result of these chemical reactions is that energy is transferred from one system <br>of interacting molecules to another. <br>In most cases, the energy needed for life is ultimately derived from the sun <br>through photosynthesis (although in some ecologically important cases, energy is <br>derived from reactions involving inorganic chemicals in the absence of sunlight—<br>e.g., chemosynthesis). Plants, algae (including phytoplankton), and other energy-<br>fixing microorganisms use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to facilitate photo-<br>synthesis, which stores energy, forms plant matter, releases oxygen, and maintains <br>plants’ activities. Plants and algae—being the resource base for animals, the ani-<br>mals that feed on animals, and the decomposers—are energy-fixing organisms that <br>sustain the rest of the food web.<br>Grade Band Endpoints for LS1.C<br>By the end of grade 2.

Animals and plants alike generally need to take in air and <br>water, animals must take in food, and plants need light and minerals; anaerobic <br>life, such as bacteria in the gut, functions without air. Food provides animals with <br>the materials they need for body repair and growth and is digested to release the <br>energy they need to maintain body warmth and for motion. Plants acquire their <br>material for growth chiefly from air and water and process matter they have <br>formed to maintain their internal conditions (e.g., at night). <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFADAD;" title="Chunk 168 | Start: 377147 | End: 379539 | Tokens: 502">By the end of grade 8. Plants, algae (including phytoplankton), and many micro-<br>organisms use the energy from light to make sugars (food) from carbon dioxide <br>from the atmosphere and water through the process of photosynthesis, which also <br>releases oxygen. These sugars can be used immediately or stored for growth or <br>later use. Animals obtain food from eating plants or eating other animals. Within <br>individual organisms, food moves through a series of chemical reactions in which <br>it is broken down and rearranged to form new molecules, to support growth, <br>or to release energy. In most animals and plants, oxygen reacts with carbon-<br>containing molecules (sugars) to provide energy and produce carbon dioxide; <br>anaerobic bacteria achieve their energy needs in other chemical processes that do <br>not require oxygen. <br>By the end of grade 12. The process of photosynthesis converts light energy to <br>stored chemical energy by converting carbon dioxide plus water into sugars plus <br>released oxygen. The sugar molecules thus formed contain carbon, hydrogen, <br>and oxygen; their hydrocarbon backbones are used to make amino acids and <br>other carbon-based molecules that can be assembled into larger molecules (such <br>as proteins or DNA), used for example to form new cells. As matter and energy <br>flow through different organizational levels of living systems, chemical elements <br>are recombined in different ways to form different products. As a result of these <br>chemical reactions, energy is transferred from one system of interacting molecules <br>to another. For example, aerobic (in the presence of oxygen) cellular respiration <br>is a chemical process in which the bonds of food molecules and oxygen molecules <br>are broken and new compounds are formed that can transport energy to muscles. <br>Anaerobic (without oxygen) cellular respiration follows a different and less effi-<br>cient chemical pathway to provide energy in cells. Cellular respiration also releases <br>the energy needed to maintain body temperature despite ongoing energy loss to <br>the surrounding environment. Matter and energy are conserved in each change. <br>This is true of all biological systems, from individual cells to ecosystems. <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Each receptor can respond to different inputs (elec-<br>tromagnetic, mechanical, chemical), some receptors respond by transmitting <br>impulses that travel along nerve cells.

Organisms <br>rely on physical factors, such as light, tem-<br>perature, water, soil, and space for shelter <br>and reproduction. Earth’s varied combina-<br>tions of these factors provide the physical environments in which its ecosystems <br>(e.g., deserts, grasslands, rain forests, and coral reefs) develop and in which the <br>diverse species of the planet live. Within any one ecosystem, the biotic interactions <br>between organisms (e.g., competition, predation, and various types of facilitation, <br>such as pollination) further influence their growth, survival, and reproduction, <br>both individually and in terms of their populations. <br>Grade Band Endpoints for LS2.A<br>By the end of grade 2.

Energy from light is needed for plants <br>because the chemical reaction that produces plant matter from air and water <br>requires an energy input to occur. Animals acquire matter from food, that is, from <br>plants or other animals. The chemical elements that make up the molecules of <br>organisms pass through food webs and the environment and are combined and <br>recombined in different ways. At each level in a food web, some matter provides <br>energy for life functions, some is stored in newly made structures, and much is dis-<br>carded to the surrounding environment. Only a small fraction of the matter con-<br>sumed at one level is captured by the next level up.

DNA molecules contain four different kinds of building blocks, called <br>nucleotides, linked together in a sequential chain. The sequence of nucleotides <br>spells out the information in a gene.

Changes (muta-<br>tions) to genes can result in changes to proteins, which can affect the structures <br>and functions of the organism and thereby change traits. <br>Sexual reproduction provides for transmission of genetic information to <br>offspring through egg and sperm cells.

Thus offspring possess one instance of each parent’s chromosome pair <br>(forming a new chromosome pair).

Sometimes the differences in characteristics between <br>individuals of the same species provide advantages in surviving, finding mates, <br>and reproducing.<br>By the end of grade 8. Genetic variations among individuals in a population give <br>some individuals an advantage in surviving and reproducing in their environment. <br>This is known as natural selection. It leads to the predominance of certain traits <br>in a population and the suppression of others. In artificial selection, humans have <br>the capacity to influence certain characteristics of organisms by selective breeding. <br>One can choose desired parental traits determined by genes, which are then passed <br>on to offspring.<br>By the end of grade 12. Natural selection occurs only if there is both (1) varia-<br>tion in the genetic information between organisms in a population and (2) varia-<br>tion in the expression of that genetic information—that is, trait variation—that <br>leads to differences in performance among individuals. The traits that positively <br>affect survival are more likely to be reproduced and thus are more common in <br>the population.<br>LS4.C: ADAPTATION<br>How does the environment influence populations of organisms over multiple <br>generations?<br>When an environment changes, there can be subsequent shifts in its supply of <br>resources or in the physical and biological challenges it imposes. Some individu-<br>als in a population may have morphological, physiological, or behavioral traits <br>that provide a reproductive advantage in the face of the shifts in the environment. <br>Natural selection provides a mechanism for species to adapt to changes in their <br>environment. The resulting selective pressures influence the survival and repro-<br>duction of organisms over many generations and can change the distribution of <br>traits in the population. This process is called adaptation. Adaptation can lead to <br>organisms that are better suited for their environment because individuals with <br></span><span style="background-color: #FDFFB6;" title="Chunk 186 | Start: 418793 | End: 421079 | Tokens: 505">the traits adaptive to the environmental change pass those traits on to their off-<br>spring, whereas individuals with traits that are less adaptive produce fewer or no <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

In some <br>cases, however, traits that are adaptive to the changed environment do not exist in <br>the population and the species becomes extinct. Adaptive changes due to natural <br>selection, as well as the net result of speciation minus extinction, have strongly <br>contributed to the planet’s biodiversity. <br>Adaption by natural selection is ongoing. For example it is seen in the emer-<br>gence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Organisms like bacteria, in which multiple <br>generations occur over shorter time spans, evolve more rapidly than those for <br>which each generation takes multiple years.<br>Grade Band Endpoints for LS4.C<br>By the end of grade 2. Living things can survive only where their needs are met. <br>If some places are too hot or too cold or have too little water or food, plants and <br>animals may not be able to live there.<br>By the end of grade 5. Changes in an organism’s habitat are sometimes benefi-<br>cial to it and sometimes harmful. For any particular environment, some kinds of <br>organisms survive well, some survive less well, and some cannot survive at all.<br>By the end of grade 8. Adaptation by natural selection acting over generations is <br>one important process by which species change over time in response to changes <br>in environmental conditions. Traits that support successful survival and reproduc-<br>tion in the new environment become more common; those that do not become <br>less common. Thus, the distribution of traits in a population changes. In separated <br>populations with different conditions, the changes can be large enough that the <br>populations, provided they remain separated (a process called reproductive isola-<br>tion), evolve to become separate species. <br>By the end of grade 12. Natural selection is the result of four factors: (1) the <br>potential for a species to increase in number, (2) the genetic variation of indi-<br></span><span style="background-color: #CAFFBF;" title="Chunk 187 | Start: 421079 | End: 423380 | Tokens: 497">viduals in a species due to mutation and sexual reproduction, (3) competition <br>for an environment’s limited supply of the resources that individuals need in <br>order to survive and reproduce, and (4) the ensuing proliferation of those organ-<br>isms that are better able to survive and reproduce in that environment. Natural <br>selection leads to adaptation—that is, to a population dominated by organisms <br>that are anatomically, behaviorally, and physiologically well suited to survive <br>and reproduce in a specific environment. That is, the differential survival and <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Biodiversity is the wide range of exist-<br>ing life forms that have adapted to the variety of conditions <br>on Earth, from terrestrial to marine ecosystems. Biodiversity <br>includes genetic variation within a species, in addition to spe-<br>cies variation in different habitats and ecosystem types (e.g., <br>forests, grasslands, wetlands). Changes in biodiversity can <br>influence humans’ resources, such as food, energy, and medi-<br>cines, as well as ecosystem services that humans rely on—for <br>example, water purification and recycling.<br>By the end of grade 12. Biodiversity is increased by the for-<br>mation of new species (speciation) and decreased by the loss <br>of species (extinction). Biological extinction, being irrevers-<br>ible, is a critical factor in reducing the planet’s natural capital. <br>Humans depend on the living world for the resources <br>and other benefits provided by biodiversity. But human activ-<br>ity is also having adverse impacts on biodiversity through <br>overpopulation, overexploitation, habitat destruction, pol-<br></span><span style="background-color: #A0C4FF;" title="Chunk 189 | Start: 425542 | End: 427339 | Tokens: 491">lution, introduction of invasive species, and climate change. <br>These problems have the potential to cause a major wave of <br>biological extinctions—as many species or populations of a <br>given species, unable to survive in changed environments, die <br>out—and the effects may be harmful to humans and other living things.

Thus ESS involve phe-<br>nomena that range in scale from the unimaginably large to the invisibly small. <br>Earth and space sciences have much in common with the other branches <br>of science, but they also include a unique set of scientific pursuits. Inquiries <br>into the physical sciences (e.g., forces, energy, gravity, magnetism) were pursued <br>in part as a means of understanding the size, age, structure, composition, and <br>behavior of Earth, the sun, and the moon; physics and chemistry later developed <br>as separate disciplines. The life sciences likewise are partially rooted in earth <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFC6FF;" title="Chunk 191 | Start: 429273 | End: 431442 | Tokens: 506">science, as Earth remains the only example of a biologically active planet, and <br>the fossils found in the geological record of rocks are of interest to both life sci-<br>entists and earth scientists. As a result, the majority of research in ESS is inter-<br>disciplinary in nature and falls under the categories of astrophysics, geophysics, <br>geochemistry, and geobiology. However, the underlying traditional discipline of <br>geology, involving the identification, analysis, and mapping of rocks, remains a <br>cornerstone of ESS.<br>Earth consists of a set of systems—atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, <br>and biosphere—that are intricately interconnected.

Small changes in one part of one system can have <br>large and sudden consequences in parts of other systems, or they can have no <br>effect at all. Understanding the different processes that cause Earth to change <br>over time (in a sense, how it “works”) therefore requires knowledge of the <br>Dimension 3<br>DISCIPLINARY CORE IDEAS—EARTH AND <br>SPACE SCIENCES<br>7<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

In addition, Earth is part of <br>a broader system—the solar system—which is itself a small part of one of the <br>many galaxies in the universe. <br>Because organizing ESS content is complex, given its broad scope and inter-<br>disciplinary nature, past efforts to promote earth sciences literacy have presented <br>this content in a wide variety of ways. In this chapter, we begin at the largest <br>spatial scales of the universe and move toward increasingly smaller scales and a <br>more anthropocentric focus. Thus, the first core idea, ESS1: Earth’s Place in the <br>Universe, describes the universe as a whole and addresses its grand scale in both <br>space and time. This idea includes the overall structure, composition, and history <br>of the universe, the forces and processes by which the solar system operates, and <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFADAD;" title="Chunk 192 | Start: 431442 | End: 433496 | Tokens: 508">Earth’s planetary history. <br>The second core idea, ESS2: Earth’s Systems, encompasses the processes <br>that drive Earth’s conditions and its continual evolution (i.e., change over time). It <br>addresses the planet’s large-scale structure and composition, describes its individ-<br>ual systems, and explains how they are interrelated. It also focuses on the mecha-<br>nisms driving Earth’s internal motions and on the vital role that water plays in all <br>of the planet’s systems and surface processes. <br>The third core idea, ESS3: Earth and Human Activity, addresses society’s <br>interactions with the planet. Connecting the ESS to the intimate scale of human <br>life, this idea explains how Earth’s processes affect people through natural resourc-<br>es and natural hazards, and it describes as well some of the ways in which human-<br>ity in turn affects Earth’s processes. See Box 7-1 for a summary of the core and <br>component ideas. <br>The committee’s efforts have been strongly influenced by several recent <br>efforts in the ESS community that have codified the essential sets of information <br>in several fields.

The selection <br>of much of the framework’s content was informed by these documents, thereby <br>ensuring that the ESS core ideas we present are not only current and accurate but <br>also relevant; they express content that the science research communities them-<br>selves recognize as being most important. <br>The framework includes a broader range of ideas in ESS than previous <br>efforts related to science education standards, largely because of pertinent recent <br>developments in ESS and the increasing societal importance of Earth-related <br>issues.

And many of the conclusions drawn <br>from this science, along with some of the evidence from which they are drawn, are <br>accessible to today’s students. Consequently, the story of Earth and the evolution <br>of its systems, as it can be understood at the K-12 level, is much richer than what <br></span><span style="background-color: #FDFFB6;" title="Chunk 194 | Start: 435550 | End: 437738 | Tokens: 503">has been taught at this level in the past.

The history of the universe, and of the structures and objects <br>within it, can be deciphered using observations of their present condition togeth-<br>er with knowledge of physics and chemistry. Similarly, the patterns of motion <br>of the objects in the solar system can be described and predicted on the basis of <br>observations and an understanding of gravity. Comprehension of these patterns <br>can be used to explain many Earth phenomena, such as day and night, seasons, <br>tides, and phases of the moon. Observations of other solar system objects and <br>of Earth itself can be used to determine Earth’s age and the history of large-scale <br>changes in its surface.<br>ESS1.A: THE UNIVERSE AND ITS STARS<br>What is the universe, and what goes on in stars?<br></span><span style="background-color: #CAFFBF;" title="Chunk 195 | Start: 437738 | End: 439858 | Tokens: 492">The sun is but one of a vast number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy, which is <br>one of a vast number of galaxies in the universe. <br>The universe began with a period of extreme and rapid expansion known <br>as the Big Bang, which occurred about 13.7 billion years ago.

All of Earth’s processes are the result of <br>energy flowing and matter cycling within and among these systems. For example, <br>the motion of tectonic plates is part of the cycles of convection in Earth’s mantle, <br>driven by outflowing heat and the downward pull of gravity, which result in the <br>formation and changes of many features of Earth’s land and undersea surface. <br>Weather and climate are shaped by complex interactions involving sunlight, the <br>ocean, the atmosphere, clouds, ice, land, and life forms. Earth’s biosphere has <br>changed the makeup of the geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere over geologi-<br>cal time; conversely, geological events and conditions have influenced the evolu-<br>tion of life on the planet.

The atmosphere is the envelope of gas surrounding the planet. The hydro-<br>sphere is the ice, water vapor, and liquid water in the atmosphere, ocean, lakes, <br>streams, soils, and groundwater. The presence of living organisms of any type <br>defines the biosphere; life can be found in many parts of the geosphere, hydro-<br>sphere, and atmosphere.

Transfers of energy and the movements of matter can cause chem-<br>ical and physical changes among Earth’s materials and living organisms. <br>Solid rocks, for example, can be formed by the cooling of molten rock, the <br>accumulation and consolidation of sediments, or the alteration of older rocks by <br>heat, pressure, and fluids. These processes occur under different circumstances <br>and produce different types of rock. Physical and chemical interactions among <br>rocks, sediments, water, air, and plants and animals produce soil. In the carbon, <br>water, and nitrogen cycles, materials cycle between living and nonliving forms and <br>among the atmosphere, soil, rocks, and ocean. <br>Weather and climate are driven by interactions of the geosphere, hydro-<br>sphere, and atmosphere, with inputs of energy from the sun. The tectonic and <br>volcanic processes that create and build mountains and plateaus, for example, <br>as well as the weathering and erosion processes that break down these struc-<br>tures and transport the products, all involve interactions among the geosphere, <br>hydrosphere, and atmosphere. The resulting landforms and the habitats they <br>provide affect the biosphere, which in turn modifies these habitats and affects <br>the atmosphere, particularly through imbalances between the carbon capture <br>and oxygen release that occur in photosynthesis, and the carbon release and <br></span><span style="background-color: #CAFFBF;" title="Chunk 203 | Start: 454882 | End: 457100 | Tokens: 510">oxygen capture that occur in respiration and in the burning of fossil fuels to <br>support human activities. <br>Earth exchanges mass and energy with the rest of the solar system.

Climate is longer term and <br>location sensitive; it is the range of a region’s weather over 1 year or many years, <br>and, because it depends on latitude and geography, it varies from place to place. <br>Weather and climate are shaped by complex interactions involving sunlight, the <br>ocean, the atmosphere, ice, landforms, and living things. These interactions can <br>drive changes that occur over multiple time scales—from days, weeks, and months <br>for weather to years, decades, centuries, and beyond—for climate.<br>The ocean exerts a major influence on weather and climate. It absorbs and <br>stores large amounts of energy from the sun and releases it very slowly; in that <br>way, the ocean moderates and stabilizes global climates. Energy is redistributed <br>globally through ocean currents (e.g., the Gulf Stream) and also through atmo-<br>spheric circulation (winds). Sunlight heats Earth’s surface, which in turn heats the <br>atmosphere. The resulting temperature patterns, together with Earth’s rotation <br>and the configuration of continents and oceans, control the large-scale patterns of <br></span><span style="background-color: #FDFFB6;" title="Chunk 210 | Start: 470064 | End: 472228 | Tokens: 500">atmospheric circulation. Winds gain energy and water vapor content as they cross <br>hot ocean regions, which can lead to tropical storms. <br>The “greenhouse effect” keeps Earth’s surface warmer than it would be <br>otherwise. To maintain any average temperature over time, energy inputs from <br>the sun and from radioactive decay in Earth’s interior must be balanced by <br>energy loss due to radiation from the upper atmosphere. However, what deter-<br>mines the temperature at which this balance occurs is a complex set of absorp-<br>tion, reflection, transmission, and redistribution processes in the atmosphere and <br>oceans that determine how long energy stays trapped in these systems before <br>being radiated away. Certain gases in the atmosphere (water vapor, carbon diox-<br>ide, methane, and nitrous oxides), which absorb and retain energy that radiates <br>from Earth’s surface, essentially insulate the planet. Without this phenomenon, <br>Earth’s surface would be too cold to be habitable. However, changes in the <br>atmosphere, such as increases in carbon dioxide, can make regions of Earth too <br>hot to be habitable by many species.<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Weather and climate are influenced by interactions involv-<br>ing sunlight, the ocean, the atmosphere, ice, landforms, and living things. These <br>interactions vary with latitude, altitude, and local and regional geography, all of <br>which can affect oceanic and atmospheric flow patterns. Because these patterns <br>are so complex, weather can be predicted only probabilistically. <br>The ocean exerts a major influence on weather and climate by absorbing <br>energy from the sun, releasing it over time, and globally redistributing it through <br>ocean currents. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and retain the energy <br>radiated from land and ocean surfaces, thereby regulating Earth’s average surface <br>temperature and keeping it habitable. <br>By the end of grade 12. The foundation for Earth’s global climate system is the <br>electromagnetic radiation from the sun as well as its reflection, absorption, stor-<br>age, and redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and land systems and this <br>energy’s reradiation into space. Climate change can occur when certain parts of <br>Earth’s systems are altered. Geological evidence indicates that past climate changes <br>were either sudden changes caused by alterations in the atmosphere; longer term <br>changes (e.g., ice ages) due to variations in solar output, Earth’s orbit, or the <br>orientation of its axis; or even more gradual atmospheric changes due to plants <br>and other organisms that captured carbon dioxide and released oxygen. The time <br>scales of these changes varied from a few to millions of years.

The properties and <br>conditions of Earth and its atmosphere affect the environments and conditions <br>within which life emerged and evolved—for example, the range of frequencies <br>of light that penetrate the atmosphere to Earth’s surface. Organisms continu-<br>ally evolve to new and often more complex forms as they adapt to new environ-<br>ments. The evolution and proliferation of living things have changed the makeup <br>of Earth’s geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere over geological time. Plants, <br>algae, and microorganisms produced <br>most of the oxygen (i.e., the O2) in the <br>atmosphere through photosynthesis, and <br>they enabled the formation of fossil fuels <br>and types of sedimentary rocks. Microbes <br>also changed the chemistry of Earth’s sur-<br>face, and they continue to play a critical <br>role in nutrient cycling (e.g., of nitrogen) <br>in most ecosystems. <br>Organisms ranging from bacteria to <br>human beings are a major driver of the <br>global carbon cycle, and they influence <br>global climate by modifying the chemical <br>makeup of the atmosphere.

Living things affect the physical characteristics of their <br>regions (e.g., plants’ roots hold soil in place, beaver shelters and human-built <br>dams alter the flow of water, plants’ respiration affects the air).

Evolution is shaped by Earth’s varying geological condi-<br>tions. Sudden changes in conditions (e.g., meteor impacts, major volcanic erup-<br>tions) have caused mass extinctions, but these changes, as well as more gradual <br>ones, have ultimately allowed other life forms to flourish. The evolution and pro-<br>liferation of living things over geological time have in turn changed the rates of <br>weathering and erosion of land surfaces, altered the composition of Earth’s soils <br>and atmosphere, and affected the distribution of water in the hydrosphere. <br>By the end of grade 12.

Some of these resources are renewable over human lifetimes, and <br>some are nonrenewable (mineral resources and fossil fuels) or irreplaceable if lost <br>(extinct species).<br>Materials important to modern technological societies are not uniformly <br>distributed across the planet (e.g., oil in the Middle East, gold in California).

The <br>applications of science knowledge and practices to engineering, as well as to such <br>areas as medicine and agriculture, have contributed to the technologies and the <br>systems that support them that serve people today. Insights gained from scientific <br>discovery have altered the ways in which buildings, bridges, and cities are con-<br>structed; changed the operations of factories; led to new methods of generating <br>and distributing energy; and created new modes of travel and communication. <br>Scientific insights have informed methods of food production, waste disposal, and <br>the diagnosis and treatment of disease. In other words, science-based, or science-<br>improved, designs of technologies and systems affect the ways in which people <br>interact with each other and with the environment, and thus these designs deeply <br>influence society. <br>In turn, society influences science and engineering. Societal decisions, which <br>may be shaped by a variety of economic, political, and cultural factors, establish <br>goals and priorities for technologies’ improvement or replacement.

The ability to build and use physical, graphi-<br>cal, and mathematical models is an essential part of translating a design idea into <br>a finished product, such as a machine, building, or any other working system. <br>Because each area of engineering focuses on particular types of systems (e.g., <br>mechanical, electrical, biotechnological), engineers become expert in the elements <br>that such systems need. But whatever their fields, all engineers use models to help <br>develop and communicate solutions to design problems. <br>Models allow the designer to better understand the features of a design <br>problem, visualize elements of a possible solution, predict a design’s perfor-<br>mance, and guide the development of feasible solutions (or, if possible, the opti-<br>mal solution).

Students actively engage in scientific <br>and engineering practices in order to deepen their understanding of crosscut-<br>ting concepts and disciplinary core ideas. In the preceding chapters, we detailed <br>separately the components of the three dimensions: scientific and engineering <br>practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas. In order to achieve <br>the vision embodied in the framework and to best support students’ learning, all <br>three dimensions need to be integrated into the system of standards, curriculum, <br>instruction, and assessment.<br>WHAT INTEGRATION INVOLVES<br>The committee recognizes that integrating the three dimensions in a coherent <br>way is challenging and that examples of how it can be achieved are needed. We <br>also acknowledge that there is no single approach that defines how to integrate <br>the three dimensions into standards, curriculum, instruction, and assessment. <br>One can in fact envision many different ways to achieve such integration, with <br>the main components of the framework being conveyed with a high degree of <br>fidelity, but with different choices as to when to stress a particular practice or <br>crosscutting idea. For these reasons, in this chapter we offer only preliminary <br>examples of the type of integration we envision, noting that the development of <br>INTEGRATING THE THREE DIMENSIONS<br>9<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>218<br>standards, curriculum, instruction, and assessment that successfully integrates <br>the three dimensions is an area ripe for research and innovation.<br>Because standards guide and shape curriculum, instruction, and assessment, <br>the task of integrating the three dimensions of the framework for K-12 science <br>education begins with the development of standards. A major task for developers <br>will be to create standards that integrate the three dimensions. The committee sug-<br>gests that this integration should occur in the standards statements themselves and <br>in performance expectations that link to the standards.<br></span><span style="background-color: #FFADAD;" title="Chunk 240 | Start: 538928 | End: 541353 | Tokens: 496">Standards and performance expectations that are aligned to the framework <br>must take into account that students cannot fully understand scientific and engi-<br>neering ideas without engaging in the practices of inquiry and the discourses by <br>which such ideas are developed and refined [1-3]. At the same time, they cannot <br>learn or show competence in practices except in the context of specific content. <br>For example, students ask questions or design investigations about particular <br>phenomena, such as the growth of plants, the motion of objects, and the phases <br>of the moon. Furthermore, crosscutting concepts have value because they provide <br>students with connections and intellectual tools that are related across the differ-<br>ing areas of disciplinary content and can enrich their application of practices and <br>their understanding of core ideas. For example, being aware that it is useful to <br>analyze diverse things—such as the human body or a watershed—as systems can <br>help students generate productive questions for further study. Thus standards and <br>performance expectations must be designed to gather evidence of students’ ability <br>to apply the practices and their understanding of the crosscutting concepts in the <br>contexts of specific applications in multiple disciplinary areas. <br>In the committee’s judgment, specification of “performance expectations” is <br>an essential component of standards. This term refers to statements that describe <br>activities and outcomes that students are expected to achieve in order to demon-<br>strate their ability to understand and apply the knowledge described in the disci-<br>plinary core ideas. Following the model of the College Board’s Science Standards <br>for College Success, we agree that “performance expectations specify what stu-<br>dents should know, understand, and be able to do. . . . They also illustrate how <br>students engage in science practices to develop a better understanding of the essen-<br>tial knowledge. These expectations support targeted instruction and assessment by <br>providing tasks that are measurable and observable” [4]. <br>In this chapter we provide two examples of how the three dimensions might <br>be brought together in performance expectations. The first example is based on a <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

A detailed discussion of all the ways in which practices, crosscut-<br>ting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas can be integrated into curriculum and <br>instruction is beyond the scope of the framework. However, in addition to the <br>examples of performance expectations presented in Tables 9-1 and 9-2, we pro-<br>vide a single example that shows first steps toward this kind of integration. This <br>example, which draws on the first component of the first physical science core <br>idea—PS1.A: Structure and Properties of Matter—shows how a disciplinary core <br>idea can be developed using particular practices and linked to particular crosscut-<br>ting concepts for each grade band. It also describes some of the ways in which stu-<br>dents might be asked to use specific practices to demonstrate their understanding <br>of core ideas. Finally, the example incorporates boundary statements that make <br>explicit what is not expected of students at a given level. The committee recom-<br>mends that boundary statements be incorporated into standards so as to provide <br>guidance for curriculum developers and designers of instruction. Such boundar-<br>ies serve two purposes: (1) to delimit what level of detail is appropriate and (2) <br>to indicate what knowledge related to a core idea may be too challenging for all <br>students to master by the end of the grade band. However, any boundaries intro-<br>duced here or in the specification of performance expectations will need to be sub-<br>jected to further research and revisited over time, as more is learned about what <br>level of expectation is appropriate in the context of curricula and instruction of <br>the type envisaged in this framework.<br>It is important to note that this example is not intended as a complete <br>description of instruction but only as a sketch of some experiences that can <br>support learning of the core idea component. It illustrates how the practices <br>both help students learn and provide a means by which they can demonstrate <br>their understanding. <br>TWO ILLUSTRATIONS OF PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS<br></span><span style="background-color: #FDFFB6;" title="Chunk 242 | Start: 543626 | End: 545716 | Tokens: 511">Two examples in this section illustrate how the three dimensions can be integrated <br>into performance expectations.

Within individual <br>organisms, food moves through a series of <br>chemical reactions in which it is broken down <br>and rearranged to form new molecules, <br></span><span style="background-color: #A0C4FF;" title="Chunk 245 | Start: 549743 | End: 551947 | Tokens: 499">to support growth or to release energy. In <br>animals and plants oxygen reacts with carbon-<br>containing molecules (sugars) to provide energy <br>and produce waste carbon dioxide; anaerobic <br>bacteria achieve their energy needs in other <br>chemical processes that do not need oxygen.<br> <br>The process of photosynthesis converts light energy <br>to stored chemical energy by converting carbon <br>dioxide and water into sugars plus released oxygen. <br>The sugar molecules thus formed contain carbon, <br>hydrogen, and oxygen, and they are used to make <br>amino acids and other carbon-based molecules <br>that can be assembled into the larger molecules <br>(such as proteins or DNA) needed to form new <br>cells.

Rather, the committee emphasizes that there are many different <br>ways to explore the disciplinary core ideas through the practices and crosscutting <br>concepts but that such exploration is critical to aid student’s development and <br>support the deep conceptual change needed to move their understanding of the <br>world closer to that of well-established scientific understandings.<br>The central question of PS1.A is “How do particles combine to form the <br>variety of matter one observes?” In the design of curriculum and instruction <br>regarding answers to this question, four of the crosscutting concepts (flagged <br>in italics below) play important roles. First, across all grade levels, the relation-<br>ship of structure and function is a key concept in studying how the structure of <br>matter relates to the properties of matter. Second, the concept of patterns can <br>be explored from the earliest grades as students investigate the various types of <br>matter, discover their commonalities, and devise ways of characterizing their <br>properties.

Fourth, as students encounter the notion that <br>matter is conserved, critical to their understanding is the crosscutting concept of <br>energy and matter: flows, cycles, and conservation. <br>The narrative for each grade band begins with a statement of the grade <br>band endpoint (“By the end of . . .”), and the succeeding text elaborates on the <br>grade band progression of learning that builds toward that endpoint; discussion <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>231<br>Integrating the Three Dimensions<br>shows how the progression involves both crosscutting concepts that students <br>come to appreciate and practices in which they might engage as they develop and <br>demonstrate their understanding. The discussion is followed by a boundary state-<br>ment, which specifies things that do not need to be included in the grade band. <br>Standards developers also should include such boundaries so as to delimit how far <br>students, of whatever grade, are expected to progress. <br>Grades K-2: Endpoint and Progression<br>By the end of grade 2. Different kinds of matter exist (e.g., wood, metal, <br>water), and many of them can be either solid or liquid, depending on tem-<br>perature. Matter can be described and classified by its observable properties <br>(e.g., visual, aural, textural), by its uses, and by whether it occurs naturally or <br>is manufactured. Different properties are suited to different purposes. A great <br>variety of objects can be built up from a small set of pieces. Objects or samples <br>of a substance can be weighed and their size can be described and measured. <br>(Boundary: Volume is introduced only for liquid measure.)<br>Students’ investigations of matter begin with guided experiences, designed <br>by the teacher, that introduce them to various kinds of matter (e.g., wood, metal, <br></span><span style="background-color: #A0C4FF;" title="Chunk 253 | Start: 566887 | End: 569304 | Tokens: 502">water, clay) in multiple contexts and engage them in discussion about the mat-<br>ter’s observable characteristics and uses. These experiences begin to elicit students’ <br>questions about matter, which they answer by conducting their own investigations <br>and by making observations; the path of the investigation is jointly designed by <br>teacher and students. Observations here include not only how things look but also <br>how they feel, how they sound when tapped, how they smell, and, in carefully <br>structured situations such as a cooking project, how they taste (although students <br>should be warned not to taste unknown substances). <br>In the course of these experiences the teacher engages and guides students <br>in identifying multiple ways of characterizing matter—such as solid and liquid, <br>natural and manufactured, hard and soft, edible or inedible—and that different <br>types of materials are suited to different uses. Across grades K-2, the variety of <br>properties of matter that students recognize and the specificity with which they <br>can characterize materials and their uses develop through experiences with dif-<br>ferent kinds of matter.<br>The ability to make measurements of quantities, such as length, liquid vol-<br>ume, weight, and temperature, begins in kindergarten with qualitative observa-<br>tions of relative magnitude. An understanding both of the arbitrariness and the <br>importance of measurement units is supported by allowing students to develop <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>232<br>their own units for length before introducing them to standard units. After stu-<br>dents observe and measure a variety of solids and liquids, classroom discussions <br>help them focus on identifying and characterizing the materials that objects are <br>made from and the reasons why particular materials are chosen for particular <br>tasks. Students are then asked to present evidence to support their claims about <br>different kinds of matter and their uses. Across the grade span, students prog-<br>ress in their ability to make and justify claims about different kinds of matter, to <br>describe and quantify those claims, and to do so both with specificity and knowl-<br>edge of the various properties of matter. <br>Starting in kindergarten (or before), students manipulate a variety of build-<br></span><span style="background-color: #BDB2FF;" title="Chunk 254 | Start: 569304 | End: 571626 | Tokens: 510">ing toys, such as wooden blocks, interlocking objects, or other construction sets, <br>leading them to recognize that although what one can build depends on the things <br>one is building from, many different objects can be constructed with multiple <br>copies of a small set of different components. Although such recognition occurs <br>implicitly, it is supported at the higher end of the grade band by explicit discus-<br>sion of this aspect of material objects. Students come to understand more deeply <br>that most objects can be broken down into various component pieces and that any <br>“chunk” of uniform matter (e.g., a sheet of paper, a block of wood, a wedge of <br>cheese) can be subdivided into smaller pieces of the same material.<br>Students’ building efforts progress from free play to solving design prob-<br>lems, and teachers facilitate this progression by asking appropriate questions <br>about the objects that students build, by having them draw diagrams of what <br>they have built, and by directing their attention to built objects outside the <br>classroom (so as to discuss what these objects are built from or features of their <br>design). By grade 2, a student should be able to follow a plan, preplan designs <br>for simple projects, and recognize the common design elements of certain types <br>of objects and the properties required—why axles are needed for wheels, for <br>example, or why metal would be used for a frying pan and why rubber or plas-<br>tic would be suitable for rain boots.<br>The awareness that some materials (not just water but also chocolate, wax, <br>and ice cream, for example) can be either liquid or solid depending on the tempera-<br>ture and that there is a characteristic temperature for each material at which this <br>transition occurs is another important concept about matter that should be devel-<br>oped in this grade band through teacher-guided student experiences and investiga-<br>tions. The transition from liquid to gas is not stressed in this grade band, however, <br>because the concept of gases other than air, or even the fact that air is matter, cannot <br>readily be developed on the basis of students’ observations and experiences. <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

In this grade band, crosscutting concepts are referred to <br>when they support development of the idea under study, but they are not stressed <br>as separate ideas. For example, students may be asked to recognize patterns in the <br>use of particular materials, but the idea that patterns are an important phenome-<br>non to investigate is not stressed. Similarly, classroom discussion may focus on the <br>components of a machine (e.g., a bicycle, a toaster) and on the roles they play, but <br>the idea of a system is not stressed. The ideas of parts too small to see, gases other <br>than air, evaporation, and condensation are not stressed either, and the conserva-<br>tion of matter when burning or evaporating is not introduced. Mass and weight <br>are not distinguished when examining matter quantity, and volume is introduced <br>only for liquids. <br>Grades 3-5: Endpoint and Progression<br>By the end of grade 5. Matter of any type can be subdivided into particles <br>that are too small to see, but even then the matter still exists and can be <br>detected by other means (e.g., by weighing, by its effects on other objects). <br>For example, a model that gases are made from matter particles too small <br>to see that are moving freely around in space can explain such observations <br>as the impacts of gas particles on surfaces (e.g., of a balloon) and on larger <br>particles or objects (e.g., wind, dust suspended in air) and the appearance of <br>visible scale water droplets in condensation, fog, and, by extension, clouds or <br>contrails of a jet. The amount (weight) of matter is conserved when it changes <br>form, even in transitions in which it seems to vanish (e.g., sugar in solution, <br>evaporation in a closed container). Measurements of a variety of proper-<br>ties (e.g., hardness, reflectivity) can be used to identify particular materials. <br>(Boundary: At this grade level, mass and weight are not distinguished, and <br>no attempt is made to define the unseen particles or explain the atomic-scale <br>mechanism of evaporation and condensation.)<br>Exploration of matter continues in this grade band with greater emphasis <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFADAD;" title="Chunk 256 | Start: 573726 | End: 575961 | Tokens: 510">on detailed measurement of objects and materials, and the idea that matter is <br>conserved even in transitions when it changes form or seems to disappear (as in <br>dissolving) begins to be developed. A critical step is to recognize from experience <br>that weight is an additive property of matter—namely, that the weight of a set of <br>objects is the sum of the weights of the component objects. Once students under-<br>stand that weight is a measure of how much matter is present, their observations <br>in that regard—such as the total weight of the water and sugar being the same <br>before and after dissolving, or the weight of the water formed by melting ice being <br>equal to the weight of the ice that melted—can be used to convey the idea that <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>234<br>matter is conserved across transitions. (The distinction between mass and weight <br>is not introduced at this grade band.) <br>Two important ideas—that gas is a form of matter and that it is modeled <br>as a collection of particles (i.e., pieces of matter too small to see) moving around <br>in space—are developed by the end of grade 5, with careful support from guided <br>investigations and the use of simulations. Multiple learning experiences are needed <br>for students to shift their concept of matter to include the gaseous state, and such <br>experiences must accordingly be structured over time. <br>First, the idea that matter can be subdivided into ever-smaller pieces without <br>changing the total amount of matter (regardless of how small the pieces are) is <br>developed by carrying out a dividing and weighing activity with one or more sub-<br>stances. The students should engage in discussions of what would happen if one <br>were to keep subdividing until the pieces were too small to see. <br>Next, the idea that matter is made of particles too small to see can be <br>extended to encompass gases as a form of matter. Air is the first familiar-yet-<br>invisible material that students can <br>learn to identify as a gas made of <br>particles. This recognition is sup-<br>ported by the use of an appropri-<br>ately designed simulation of par-<br></span><span style="background-color: #FFD6A5;" title="Chunk 257 | Start: 575961 | End: 578136 | Tokens: 497">ticles moving around in a container, <br>as well as by observations aimed <br>at emphasizing the properties of <br>air as a material (e.g., one can feel <br>it, it affects other things, a balloon <br>blown up weighs more than an <br>empty balloon). Students should be <br>helped to relate the observed prop-<br>erties of air to the characteristics <br>of the simulation (e.g., the impacts of particles on surfaces) and also to their own <br>experiences with visible particles, such as the movement of dust particles in air or <br>the impacts of blowing sand on the skin. <br>Also by the end of grade 5, students’ understanding of gases needs to <br>progress a step beyond recognizing air as samples of materials. It should include <br>recognition that the water remains the same kind of matter during evaporation <br>and condensation, just as it does during melting and freezing. The fact that the <br>amount of material remains the same as water is frozen and then melted again can <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>235<br>Integrating the Three Dimensions<br>be observed by weighing, and such continuity can be reaffirmed by freezing and <br>melting a variety of other materials (e.g., various juices). Similarly, the amount of <br>material remains the same as water is put through sequences of evaporation and <br>condensation in a closed system (such as a plastic container with a lid)—a fact <br>that can be confirmed with observation and measurement. The stress here is on <br>qualitative comparative observations, not on precision measurements.<br>The additivity of volumes is a subtler concept than the addition of weights, <br>and it must be developed with care so as not to introduce misconceptions. For like <br>materials (e.g., water plus water, sand plus sand), volume is additive, but students <br>should also be engaged in experiences in which volumes (as measured by a gradu-<br>ated container) do not combine additively, as when sand is added to a container of <br>marbles, or rocks and pebbles are mixed together. With such examples, students <br>can shift their perception of continuous matter to one that allows for a particle-<br></span><span style="background-color: #FDFFB6;" title="Chunk 258 | Start: 578136 | End: 580567 | Tokens: 505">based substructure. <br>In this grade band, however, definition of the particles involved is not <br>stressed; rather, the objective is for students to begin developing and using mod-<br>els to explain observations. For example, they can build a model to explain why, <br>when a volume of water is added to a volume of rubbing alcohol, the volume of <br>the combined sample is less than the sum of the volumes of the starting samples. <br>(Note that this experience requires careful measurement with appropriate mea-<br>suring equipment—an ability that also is developed across this grade band.) The <br>evolution of students’ mental models of matter is facilitated by relating this experi-<br>ence to similar situations with macroscopic objects, such as the mixture of sand <br>and marbles described above, and to simulations that provide an explicit visible <br>model of the situation. In any case, this example is just one of the many ways in <br>which students can begin to see that observed properties of matter are explainable <br>in terms of a particle model. <br>Students’ understanding of the categories of matter, properties of matter, <br>and uses of matter is refined and expanded across this grade band. Categories of <br>matter, such as metals and crystals, and the names of particular materials, such as <br>iron or silicon, may be introduced in conjunction with experiences or investiga-<br>tions that help students identify the characteristics that distinguish one material <br>from others, thereby allowing it to be categorized. However, no stress is placed on <br>chemical formulas or symbols for substances. Based on studies of various kinds <br>of matter and their properties (such as heat conduction, elasticity, or reflectivity), <br>students can present evidence that measurements of a variety of properties are <br>useful in identifying particular materials. Similarly, based on measurements that <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Students also are encouraged to apply their understanding <br>of matter in selecting materials for design purposes.<br>Throughout this grade band, all of the scientific and engineering practices <br></span><span style="background-color: #CAFFBF;" title="Chunk 259 | Start: 580567 | End: 582835 | Tokens: 504">begin to be developed explicitly, and the crosscutting concepts (flagged in ital-<br>ics below) are used to begin making linkages across disciplinary core ideas—for <br>example, to connect students’ understanding of matter conservation (e.g., in <br>evaporation and condensation, as described above) to their understanding of the <br>water cycle in earth science. Students also note patterns in their observations, rec-<br>ognizing that any pattern can be a clue that needs further investigation and expla-<br>nation. By the end of grade 5, students should have developed both the ability and <br>the habit of creating models, giving model-based explanations, and relating their <br>models to evidence and inferences drawn from observations. Furthermore, build-<br>ing on their more general models of the substructure of matter, they recognize that <br>it is useful to develop an explicit system model to understand any given system. <br>Boundary Statements. In this grade band, particles are introduced as pieces of <br>matter too small to see, but their nature is not further specified; atoms and the <br>distinction between atoms and molecules are not introduced. If particular pure <br>substances, such as oxygen or iron, are named, the chemical formulas are not <br>introduced; students’ learning is confined to the familiar names of these sub-<br>stances, their important properties, and their roles in everyday experience. Mass <br>and weight are not distinguished, and although solid volume can be introduced, <br>students are not expected to be able to calculate volume, except for that of a rect-<br>angular solid. Evaporation and condensation are introduced as observable phe-<br>nomena, but the processes by which they take place are not treated at this grade <br>level. Nor is the calculation of density from measured weight and volume stressed, <br>although a qualitative sense of density as a property of matter and of relative den-<br>sities of different materials can be developed. <br>GRADES 6-8: ENDPOINT AND PROGRESSION<br>By the end of grade 8. All substances are made from some 100 different <br>types of atoms, which combine with one another in various ways. Atoms form <br>molecules that range in size from two to thousands of atoms.

In a liquid, the molecules are constantly in contact with <br>others; in a gas, they are widely spaced except when they happen to collide. <br>In a solid, atoms are closely spaced and may vibrate in position but do not <br>change relative locations. Solids may be formed from molecules, or they may <br>be extended structures with repeating subunits (e.g., crystals). The changes of <br>state that occur with variations in temperature or pressure can be described <br>and predicted using these models of matter. (Boundary: Predictions here are <br>qualitative, not quantitative.)<br>In this grade band, investigations are designed to enhance students’ ability <br>to create explicit models and to use them for developing explanations of observa-<br>tions, for building their conceptions of matter, and for analyzing new situations. <br>In particular, students develop and apply their understanding of the particle model <br>of matter. In grade 6 the particles are still not defined, but representations of the <br>states of matter (solid, liquid, and gas) include the concept that, although the par-<br>ticles are in motion in all three states, the spacing and degree of relative motion <br>differ substantially between them. The role of forces between particles also begins <br>to be discussed in grade 6—topics include the recognition that particles in a solid <br>are held together by the forces of mutual attraction and repulsion (which act like <br>springs) and that there are forces between particles in a gas that cause them to <br>change their paths when they collide. The core idea of energy developed across <br>this grade band must similarly be applied in the context of models of matter—for <br>example, to understand the temperature dependence of states of matter—and to <br>develop consistent descriptions of such phenomena as convection and conduction, <br>that is, heat transfer with and without fluid motion, respectively. <br>Across grades 6-8, investigations of matter continue to become more pre-<br></span><span style="background-color: #A0C4FF;" title="Chunk 261 | Start: 585199 | End: 587486 | Tokens: 497">cise, and students’ understanding of the particle model of matter continues to be <br>refined through comparisons with empirical observations and suggested models <br>that explain them. By grade 8, students should be able to distinguish between <br>an atom and a molecule and the roles they play in the various states of matter. <br>Students’ own investigations and their experiences in examining data from exter-<br>nal sources should be structured to help them examine their own understanding of <br>the particle model and help them move toward a better understanding. Students <br>continue to draw on and cultivate their skills in mathematics and language, in <br>recognition of the need for precision in both the measurement and interpretation <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Students <br>can connect this particle model <br>of matter to observations and <br>present arguments based on it to <br>defend the following claims: All substances are made from approximately 100 dif-<br>ferent types of atoms, which combine with one another in various ways; atoms <br>form molecules that range in size from two to thousands of atoms; gases and <br>liquids are made of molecules or inert atoms, which are moving about relative to <br>each other; and in a solid, atoms may vibrate in position but do not change rela-<br>tive locations.<br>Students can select different materials as examples to support the claim that <br>solids may be formed from molecules or may be extended structures with repeat-<br></span><span style="background-color: #BDB2FF;" title="Chunk 262 | Start: 587486 | End: 589812 | Tokens: 501">ing subunits (e.g., crystals, metals).

Students can cite <br>evidence that supports this model and relate it to the properties of matter, particu-<br>larly to the variety of elements, isotopes, and chemical properties. <br>Students use their understanding of electrical interactions to support claims <br>that the structure and interactions of matter at the bulk scale (link to PS2.A) are <br>determined by electrical forces within and between atoms. Students also use their <br>understanding of stability within systems (link to PS2.B) and the relationship <br>between forces and energy (link to PS3.C) to support claims that stable forms of <br>matter are those that minimize the energy in electric and magnetic fields within the <br>system.

For each component, we discuss what must be in place in order for it to <br>align with the framework’s vision. <br>These discussions do not include formal recommendations and are not <br>framed as standards for each component, because the committee was not asked <br>to undertake the kind of extensive review—of the research on teacher education, <br>IMPLEMENTATION<br>Curriculum, Instruction, Teacher Development, and <br>Assessment<br>10<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Indeed, the committee and the timeline for our work <br>would have required considerable expansion in order to give such an endeavor <br>adequate treatment. <br>The committee instead relied on a number of recent reports from the <br>National Research Council (NRC) that did examine research related to each of <br>the components discussed in this chapter. They include Knowing What Students <br>Know [1], Investigating the Influence of Standards [2], Systems for State Science <br>Assessment [3], America’s Lab Report [4], Taking Science to School [5], and <br>Preparing Teachers [6]. The discussions in the following sections are based primar-<br>ily on these reports.<br>Explicit standards for teaching, professional development, education pro-<br>grams, and the education system were included in the original National Science <br>Education Standards (NSES) published by the NRC in 1996 [7]. Although <br>many of these standards are still relevant to K-12 science education today, the <br>committee did not undertake a thorough review of these portions of the NSES. <br>Instead, given our charge, we focused on the NSES standards that describe sci-<br>ence content. For future efforts, we suggest that a review of the other NSES <br>standards, in light of the research and development that has taken place since <br>1996, would be very valuable; such a review could serve as an important com-<br>plement to the current effort.<br>KEY COMPONENTS OF K-12 SCIENCE EDUCATION<br></span><span style="background-color: #FDFFB6;" title="Chunk 266 | Start: 596350 | End: 598818 | Tokens: 502">The key components of science education that we consider in this chapter are <br>curriculum, instruction, teacher development, and assessment. It is difficult to <br>focus on any particular component without considering how it is influenced <br>by—and how it in turn influences—the other components. For example, what <br>students learn is clearly related to what they are taught, which itself depends <br>on many things: state science standards; the instructional materials available in <br>the commercial market and from organizations (such as state and federal agen-<br>cies) with science-related missions; the curriculum adopted by the local board <br>of education; teachers’ knowledge and practices for teaching; how teachers <br>elect to use the curriculum; the kinds of resources, time, and space that teachers <br>have for their instructional work; what the community values regarding student <br>learning; and how local, state, and national standards and assessments influ-<br>ence instructional practice.<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>243<br>Implementation: Curriculum, Instruction, Teacher Development, and Assessment<br>We are not attempting to provide a full discussion of all possible influ-<br>ences on science education; rather, we focus on four major components that have <br>critical roles to play and how they will need to evolve in order to implement the <br>kind of science education envisaged by this framework. Our discussion also does <br>not include detailed consideration of the process of gaining support for adoption <br>of standards—for example, developing public will and engaging with state and <br>local policy makers. We also do not discuss informal settings for science educa-<br>tion, which provide many opportunities for learning science that complement and <br>extend students’ experiences in school [8].<br>A Complex System<br>Much of the complexity of science education systems derives from the multiple <br>levels of control—classroom, school, school district, state, and national—across <br>which curriculum, instruction, teacher development, and assessment operate; thus <br>what ultimately happens in a classroom is significantly affected by decision mak-<br>ing distributed across the levels and multiple channels of influence.<br>Each teacher ultimately decides how and what to teach in his or her class-<br>room, but this decision is influenced by decisions at higher levels of the system. <br></span><span style="background-color: #CAFFBF;" title="Chunk 267 | Start: 598818 | End: 601243 | Tokens: 504">First, there is the effect of decisions made at the school level, which include the <br>setting of expectations and sequences in certain content areas as well as the princi-<br>pal’s, department chairs’, or team leaders’ explicit and implicit signals about teach-<br>ing and learning priorities [9]. Leaders at the school level may also make decisions <br>about the time and resources [10] allocated to different subjects within guidelines <br>and requirements set by the state, teacher hiring and assignments, the usage of sci-<br>ence labs, and, in some cases, the presence of a school building’s laboratory space <br>in the first place. The school leaders’ expectations, priorities, and decisions estab-<br>lish a climate that encourages or discourages particular pedagogical approaches, <br>collegial interactions, or inservice programs [11, 12]. Furthermore, a school’s <br>degree of commitment to equity—to providing opportunities for all students to <br>learn the same core content—can influence how students are scheduled into class-<br>es, which teachers are hired, how they are assigned to teach particular classes, and <br>how instructional resources are identified and allocated [13, 14].<br>At the next level of the system, school districts are responsible for (1) ensur-<br>ing implementation of state and federal education policies; (2) formulating addi-<br>tional local education policies; and (3) creating processes for selecting curricula, <br>purchasing curriculum materials, and determining the availability of instructional <br>resources. District leaders develop local school budgets, set instructional priorities, <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Teacher hiring and school assignment may also occur at <br>the district level. Districts may provide support structures and professional devel-<br>opment networks that enhance the capacity of schools and teachers to implement <br>effective science curriculum, instruction, and formative assessments.<br>The state level is a particularly important one for schools. States, being con-<br>stitutionally responsible for elementary and secondary education, play major roles <br></span><span style="background-color: #9BF6FF;" title="Chunk 268 | Start: 601243 | End: 603597 | Tokens: 505">in regulating and funding education—they provide nearly half of all public school <br>revenues [15], with most of the remainder coming from local property taxes. Each <br>state must develop and administer its own policies on standards, curriculum, <br>materials selection and adoption, teacher licensure, student assessment, and edu-<br>cational accountability. Across states, the authority of schools and districts to for-<br>mulate policy varies considerably. Some states have relatively high “local control,” <br>with more power residing at the district level; others states have more centralized <br>control, with more influence exerted by the state.<br>Finally, although the federal gov-<br>ernment contributes less than 10 per-<br>cent of all funds invested by states and <br>local districts in education [16], it influ-<br>ences education at all levels through <br>a combination of regulations, public <br>advocacy, and monetary incentives. For <br>example, the Elementary and Secondary <br>Education Act (No Child Left Behind <br>Act) requires the testing of students at <br>specific grade levels.<br>There are also influences from the <br>other stakeholders that have an interest <br>in science education, such as parents, <br>businesses, local communities, and professional societies. These stakeholders can <br>become engaged at all levels—national, state, local—and often have a significant <br>influence on what is taught and how it is taught. <br>Clearly, a science education system must be responsive to a variety of <br>influences—some that emanate from the top down, some from the bottom up, and <br>some laterally from outside formal channels.

However, classroom teachers in the lower grades may have some <br>latitude in how they use instructional time to meet district and state mandates.

Beyond such <br>minimum requirements, students and their parents determine the overall science <br></span><span style="background-color: #A0C4FF;" title="Chunk 269 | Start: 603597 | End: 605799 | Tokens: 499">course load that each student takes.<br>The Importance of Coherence in the System<br>The complexity of the system—with several components that are affected by or <br>operate at different levels—presents a challenge to implementation of the frame-<br>work and its related standards. Successful implementation requires that all of the <br>components across the levels cohere or work together in a harmonious or logical <br>way to support the new vision. This kind of system-wide coherence is difficult to <br>achieve, yet it is essential to the success of standards-based science education.<br>In the literature on education policy, the term “coherence” is often used <br>interchangeably with another term—“alignment” [17-19]—although others have <br>suggested that alignment alone is not sufficient to make a system coherent [20]. <br>For example, not only would a coherent curriculum be well aligned across the <br>grades or across subjects, it would also be logically organized, integrated, and har-<br>monious in its internal structure. Here we treat coherence as the broader concept <br>and alignment as only one of its dimensions. <br>A standards-based system of science education should be coherent in a <br>variety of ways [3]. It should be horizontally coherent, in the sense that the <br>curriculum-, instruction-, and assessment-related policies and practices are all <br>aligned with the standards, target the same goals for learning, and work together <br>to support students’ development of the knowledge and understanding of science. <br>The system should be vertically coherent, in the sense that there is (a) a shared <br>understanding at all levels of the system (classroom, school, school district, state, <br>and national) of the goals for science education (and for the curriculum) that <br>underlie the standards and (b) that there is a consensus about the purposes and <br>❚ A science education system must be responsive to a variety of <br>influences—some that emanate from the top down, some from the <br>bottom up, and some laterally from outside formal channels. ❚<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

The system should also be developmentally coherent, in the <br>sense that there is a shared understanding across grade levels of what ideas are <br>important to teach and of how children’s understanding of these ideas should <br>develop across grade levels.<br>CURRICULUM AND INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS<br>Curriculum refers to the knowledge and practices in subject matter areas that <br>teachers teach and that students are supposed to learn. A curriculum gener-<br>ally consists of a scope, or breadth of content, in a given subject area and of a <br>sequence of concepts and activities for learning. While standards typically outline <br>the goals of learning, curricula set forth the more specific means—materials, tasks, <br>discussions, representations—to be used to achieve those goals. <br>Curriculum is collectively defined by teachers, curriculum coordinators (at <br>both the school and the district levels), state agencies, curriculum development <br>organizations, textbook publishers, and (in the case of science) curriculum kit <br>publishers. Although standards do not prescribe specific curricula, they do pro-<br>vide some criteria for designing curricula. And in order to realize the vision of the <br>framework and standards, it is necessary that aligned instructional materials, text-<br>books, and computer or other media-based materials be developed as well. <br>Curricula based on the framework and resulting standards should integrate <br>the three dimensions—scientific and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts, <br>and disciplinary core ideas—and follow the progressions articulated in this <br>report. In order to support the vision of this framework, standards-based cur-<br>ricula in science need to be developed to provide clear guidance that helps teach-<br>ers support students engaging in scientific practices to develop explanations and <br>models [5, 21-24]. In addition, curriculum materials need to be developed as a <br>multiyear sequence that helps students develop increasingly sophisticated ideas <br>across grades K-12 [5, 25, 26]. Curriculum materials (including technology) <br>themselves are developed by a multicomponent system that includes for-profit <br>publishers as well as grant-funded work in the nonprofit sectors of the science <br>education community. The adoption of standards based on this framework by <br>multiple states may help drive publishers to align with it. Such alignment may <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFC6FF;" title="Chunk 271 | Start: 608184 | End: 610691 | Tokens: 511">at first be superficial, but schools, districts, and states can influence publishers <br>if enough of them are asking for serious alignment with the framework and the <br>standards it engenders.<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>247<br>Implementation: Curriculum, Instruction, Teacher Development, and Assessment<br>Integration of the Three Dimensions<br>The framework’s vision is that students will acquire knowledge and skill in science <br>and engineering through a carefully designed sequence of learning experiences. <br>Each stage in the sequence will develop students’ understanding of particular sci-<br>entific and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas <br>while also deepening their insights into the ways in which people from all back-<br>grounds engage in scientific and engineering work to satisfy their curiosity, seek <br>explanations about the world, and improve the built world. <br>A major question confronting each curriculum developer will be which of <br>the practices and crosscutting concepts to feature in lessons or units around a <br>particular disciplinary core idea so that, across the curriculum, they all receive suf-<br>ficient attention [27].<br>Every science unit or engineering design project must have as one of its goals <br>the development of student understanding of at least one disciplinary core idea. In <br>addition, explicit reference to each crosscutting concept will recur frequently and <br>in varied contexts across disciplines and grades. These concepts need to become <br>part of the language of science that students use when framing questions or devel-<br>oping ways to observe, describe, and explain the world. <br>Similarly, the science and engineering practices delineated in this framework <br>should become familiar as well to students through increasingly sophisticated <br>experiences with them across grades K-8 [28, 29]. Although not every such prac-<br>tice will occur in every context, the curriculum should provide repeated oppor-<br>tunities across various contexts for students to develop their facility with these <br>practices and use them as a support for developing deep understanding of the con-<br>cepts in question and of the nature of science and of engineering. This will require <br>substantial redesign of current and future curricula [30, 31]. <br>Important Aspects of Science Curriculum<br>In addition to alignment with the framework, there are many other aspects for <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFADAD;" title="Chunk 272 | Start: 610691 | End: 613108 | Tokens: 498">curriculum designers to consider that are not addressed in the framework.

All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>248<br>be better treated at the level of curriculum design than at the level of framework <br>and standards. Considerations of the historical, social, cultural, and ethical aspects <br>of science and its applications, as well as of engineering and the technologies it <br>develops, need a place in the natural science curriculum and classroom [32, 33]. <br>The framework is designed to help students develop an understanding not only <br>that the various disciplines of science and engineering are interrelated but also that <br>they are human endeavors. As such, they may raise issues that are not solved by <br>scientific and engineering methods alone. <br>For example, because decisions about the use of a particular technology raise <br>issues of costs, risks, and benefits, the associated societal and environmental impacts <br>require a broader discussion. Perspectives from history and the social and behavioral <br>sciences can enlighten the consideration of such issues; indeed, many of them are <br>addressable either in the context of a social studies course, a science course, or both. <br>In either case, the importance of argument from evidence is critical. <br>It is also important that curricula provide opportunities for discussions <br>that help students recognize that some science- or engineering-related questions, <br>such as ethical decisions or legal codes for what should or should not be done <br>in a given situation, have moral and cultural underpinnings that vary across <br>cultures. Similarly, through discussion and reflection, students can come to real-<br>ize that scientific inquiry embodies a set of values. These values include respect <br>for the importance of logical thinking, precision, open-mindedness, objectivity, <br>skepticism, and a requirement for transparent research procedures and honest <br>reporting of findings. <br>Students need opportunities, with increasing sophistication across the grade <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFD6A5;" title="Chunk 273 | Start: 613108 | End: 615483 | Tokens: 509">levels, to consider not only the applications and implications of science and engi-<br>neering in society but also the nature of the human endeavor of science and <br>engineering themselves.

All rights reserved.<br>249<br>Implementation: Curriculum, Instruction, Teacher Development, and Assessment<br>Discussions involving the history of scientific and engineering ideas, of <br>individual practitioners’ contributions, and of the applications of these endeav-<br>ors are important components of a science and engineering curriculum. For <br>many students, these aspects are the pathways that capture their interest in these <br>fields and build their identities as engaged and capable learners of science and <br>engineering [34, 35]. Teaching science and engineering without reference to <br>their rich variety of human stories, to the puzzles of the past and how they were <br>solved, and to the issues of today that science and engineering must help address <br>would be a major omission. It would isolate science and engineering from their <br>human roots, undervalue their intellectual and creative contributions, and dimin-<br>ish many students’ interest. <br>Finally, when considering how to integrate these aspects of learning into <br>the science and engineering curriculum, curriculum developers, as well as class-<br>room teachers, face many <br>further important questions. <br>For example, is a topic best <br>addressed by invoking its his-<br>torical development as a story <br>of scientific discovery? Is it <br>best addressed in the context <br>of a current problem or issue? <br>Or is it best conveyed through <br>an investigation? What tech-<br>nology or simulation tools <br>can aid student learning? In <br>addition, how are diverse stu-<br>dent backgrounds explicitly <br>engaged as resources in struc-<br>turing learning experiences <br>[36, 37]? And does the curric-<br></span><span style="background-color: #FDFFB6;" title="Chunk 274 | Start: 615483 | End: 617904 | Tokens: 509">ulum offer sufficiently varied <br>examples and opportunities so <br>that all students may identify with scientific knowledge-building practices and <br>participate fully [38, 39]? These choices occur both in the development of cur-<br>riculum materials and, as we discuss in the following section, in decisions made <br>by the teacher in planning instruction. <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>250<br>LEARNING AND INSTRUCTION<br>Instruction refers to methods of teaching and the learning activities used to help <br>students master the content and objectives specified by a curriculum. Instruction <br>encompasses the activities of both teachers and students. It can be carried out by <br>a variety of pedagogical techniques, sequences of activities, and ordering of top-<br>ics. Although the framework does not specify a particular pedagogy, integration of <br>the three dimensions will require that students be actively involved in the kinds of <br>learning opportunities that classroom research suggests are important for (1) their <br>understanding of science concepts [5, 40-42], (2) their identities as learners of sci-<br>ence [43, 44], and (3) their appreciation of scientific practices and crosscutting <br>concepts [45, 46]. <br>Several previous NRC committees working on topics related to science edu-<br>cation have independently concluded that there is not sufficient evidence to make <br>prescriptive recommendations about which approaches to science instruction are <br>most effective for achieving particular learning goals [3-5]. However, the recent <br>report Preparing Teachers noted that “there is a clear inferential link between <br>the nature of what is in the standards and the nature of classroom instruction. <br>Instruction throughout K-12 education is likely to develop science proficiency if it <br>provides students with opportunities for a range of scientific activities and scien-<br>tific thinking, including, but not limited to: inquiry and investigation, collection <br>and analysis of evidence, logical reasoning, and communication and application of <br>information” [6].<br>For example, researchers have studied classroom teaching interventions <br>involving curriculum structures that support epistemic practices (i.e., articulation <br>and evaluation of one’s own knowledge, coordination of theory and evidence) <br></span><span style="background-color: #CAFFBF;" title="Chunk 275 | Start: 617904 | End: 620280 | Tokens: 508">[47]; instructional approaches for English language learners [48]; the effects of <br>project-based curricula and teaching practices [49]; the effects of instruction on <br>core ideas, such as the origin of species [50]; and the influence of multiple repre-<br>sentations of learning [51]. Others have investigated curricular approaches and <br>instructional practices that are matched to national standards [52] or are focused <br>on model-based inquiry [24]. In some work, there is a particular interest in the <br>role of students’ learning of scientific discourses, especially argumentation [33, 53, <br>54]. Taken together, this work suggests teachers need to develop the capacity to <br>use a variety of approaches in science education.<br>Much of this work has examined pedagogical issues related to the “strands” <br>of scientific proficiency outlined in Taking Science to School [5], and we next turn <br>to those strands.<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>251<br>Implementation: Curriculum, Instruction, Teacher Development, and Assessment<br>What It Means to Learn Science<br>The NRC report Taking Science to School [5] concluded that proficiency in sci-<br>ence is multifaceted and therefore requires a range of experiences to support <br>students’ learning. That report defined the following four strands of proficiency, <br>which it maintained are interwoven in successful science learning: <br>1.	 Knowing, using, and interpreting scientific explanations of the natural <br>world.<br>2.	 Generating and evaluating scientific evidence and explanations.<br>3.	 Understanding the nature and development of scientific knowledge.<br>4.	 Participating productively in scientific practices and discourse.<br>Strand 1 includes the acquisition of facts, laws, principles, theories, and <br>models of science; the development of conceptual structures that incorporate <br>them; and the productive use of these structures to understand the natural world. <br>Students grow in their understanding of particular phenomena as well as in their <br>appreciation of the ways in which the construction of models and refinement of <br>arguments contribute to the improvement of explanations [29, 55].<br>Strand 2 encompasses the knowledge and practices needed to build and <br>refine models and to provide explanations (conceptual, computational, and <br></span><span style="background-color: #9BF6FF;" title="Chunk 276 | Start: 620280 | End: 622755 | Tokens: 507">mechanistic) based on scientific evidence. This strand includes designing empirical <br>investigations and measures for data collection, selecting representations and ways <br>of analyzing the resulting data (or data available from other sources), and using <br>empirical evidence to construct, critique, and defend scientific arguments [45, 56].<br>Strand 3 focuses on students’ understanding of science as a way of knowing. <br>Scientific knowledge is a particular kind of knowledge with its own sources, justi-<br>fications, ways of dealing with uncertainties [40], and agreed-on levels of certain-<br>ty. When students understand how scientific knowledge is developed over system-<br>atic observations across multiple investigations, how it is justified and critiqued on <br>the basis of evidence, and how it is validated by the larger scientific community, <br>the students then recognize that science entails the search for core explanatory <br>constructs and the connections between them [57]. They come to appreciate that <br>alternative interpretations of scientific evidence can occur, that such interpreta-<br>tions must be carefully scrutinized, and that the plausibility of the supporting <br>evidence must be considered. Thus students ultimately understand, regarding both <br>their own work and the historical record, that predictions or explanations can <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>252<br>be revised on the basis of seeing new evidence or of developing a new model that <br>accounts for the existing evidence better than previous models did.<br>Strand 4 includes students’ effective engagement in science practices with <br>an understanding of the norms for participating in science, such as norms for <br>constructing and presenting scientific models and explanations, for critiquing and <br>defending a claim while engaged in scientific debates, and for students’ motiva-<br>tion and attitudes toward science. For example, over time, students develop more <br>sophisticated uses of scientific talk—which includes making claims and using <br>evidence—and of scientific representations, such as graphs [58], physical models <br>[59], and written arguments [60, 61]. They come to see themselves as members <br>of a scientific community in which they test ideas, develop shared representations <br>and models, and reach consensus. Students who see science as valuable and inter-<br></span><span style="background-color: #A0C4FF;" title="Chunk 277 | Start: 622755 | End: 625123 | Tokens: 491">esting and themselves as capable science learners also tend to be capable learners <br>as well as more effective participants in science [8]. They believe that steady effort <br>in understanding science pays off—as opposed to erroneously thinking that some <br>people understand science and other people never will. To engage productively in <br>science, however, students need to understand how to participate in scientific dis-<br>cussions, how to adopt a critical stance while respecting the contributions of oth-<br>ers, and how to ask questions and revise their own opinions [62].<br>The four strands imply that learning science involves learning a system of <br>thought, discourse, and practice—all in an interconnected and social context—to <br>accomplish the goal of working with and understanding scientific ideas. This per-<br>spective stresses how conceptual understanding is linked to the ability to develop <br>explanations of phenomena and to carry out empirical investigations in order to <br>develop or evaluate those knowledge claims. Furthermore, it recognizes the con-<br>ceptual effort needed for students’ naive conceptions of the world to be modified <br>as they learn science, rather than maintained with little change even as they con-<br>tradict the material being taught. These strands are not independent or separable <br>in the practice of science, nor in the teaching and learning of science. Rather, they <br>are mutually supportive—students’ advances in one strand tend to leverage or <br>promote advances in other strands. Furthermore, students use them together when <br>engaging in scientific tasks. <br>The NRC report Learning Science in Informal Environments [8] built on <br>these proficiencies by including two additional strands. The first highlighted the <br>importance of personal interests related to science, and the second noted the <br>importance of helping learners come to identify with science as an endeavor they <br>want to seek out, engage in, and perhaps contribute to. Science-linked interests <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Thus they cannot guide standards, curricula, <br>or assessment without further specification of the knowledge and practices that <br>students must learn. The three dimensions that are developed in this framework—<br>practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas—make that specifica-<br>tion and attempt to realize the commitments to the strands of scientific literacy <br>in the four strands. There is not a simple one-to-one mapping of strands to the <br>dimensions, because the strands are interrelated aspects of how learners engage <br>with scientific ideas. Table 10-1 summarizes how the strands of scientific literacy <br>guided the design of the dimensions in the framework. <br>Implications for Instruction<br>As the report Taking Science to School concludes, “a range of instructional <br>approaches is necessary as part of a full development of the four strands of <br>proficiency. All students need to experience these different approaches” [5]. <br>“Approaches” here refer to the wide range of instructional strategies—from <br>those that are led exclusively by the teacher to those that are led primarily by the <br>student—that teachers can employ in science classrooms. Instruction may involve <br>teacher talk and questioning, or teacher-led activities, or collaborative small-group <br>investigations [63], or student-led activities. The extent of each alternative varies, <br>depending on the initial ideas that <br>students bring to learning (and their <br>consequent needs for scaffolding), the <br>nature of the content involved, and <br>the available curriculum support. <br>Current research in K-12 sci-<br>ence classrooms reveals that earlier <br>debates about such dichotomies as <br>“direct instruction” and “inquiry” <br>are simplistic, even mistaken, as a <br>characterization of science pedagogy <br>[5].

Recent research has focused on the <br>kinds of teacher knowledge to be addressed [78-82], particular programs and <br>courses for prospective teachers [83], and how induction programs (which provide <br>early mentoring and evaluation experiences, for example) can support new teach-<br>ers [84]. However, an NRC committee charged with reviewing teacher prepara-<br>tion programs concluded that there is virtually “no systematic information on the <br>content or practices of preparation programs or requirements for science teachers <br>across states” [6].

Given these circumstances, <br>the discussion in the following subsections is based on the information available, <br>the committee’s professional judgments, and logical inferences about what knowl-<br>edge and skills teachers need to have in order to provide the learning experiences <br>implied by the framework.<br>Preservice Experiences<br>Prospective science teachers will need science courses and other experiences that <br>provide a thorough grounding in all three of the framework’s dimensions [97]. Thus <br>science teacher preparation must develop teachers’ focus on, and deepen their under-<br>standing of the crosscutting concepts, disciplinary core ideas [98, 99], and scientific <br>and engineering practices [100] so as to better engage their students in these dimen-<br>sions [101, 102]. The goal of building students’ understanding of the core ideas over <br>multiple grades means that teachers will need to appreciate both the current intellec-<br>tual capabilities of their students and their developmental trajectories [103]. Toward <br>this end, preservice teachers will need experiences that help them understand how <br>students think, what they are capable of doing, and what they might reasonably be <br>expected to do under supportive instructional conditions [81]. <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

This means introducing prospective teach-<br>ers to a spectrum of scientific investigations, including simple investigations in the <br>classroom using everyday materials, field studies outside the classroom [6], formal <br>experiments carried out in the laboratory [104], and student-designed investiga-<br>tions [54]. Teachers also need opportunities to develop the knowledge and practic-<br>es to support these investigations, including how to prepare, organize, and main-<br></span><span style="background-color: #9BF6FF;" title="Chunk 284 | Start: 639311 | End: 641756 | Tokens: 498">tain materials; implement safety protocols; organize student groups; and guide <br>students as they collect, represent, analyze, discuss data, argue from evidence, and <br>draw conclusions [80].<br>Given that prospective teachers often rely heavily on curricular materials to <br>guide their preparation and teaching, they will also need experiences in analyzing <br>and revising curricular materials using standards- and research-based criteria [105, <br>106]. In addition, in this age of accountability, new teachers will need support in <br>developing their knowledge of forms of assessment [79].<br>Beyond investigations, the discourse practices also are an important com-<br>ponent of the framework [82, 107]; teachers will need support to learn how to <br>facilitate appropriate and effective discourse in their classrooms [108, 109]. The <br>emphasis on modeling is also new and will need to be an explicit element of teach-<br>er preparation [75, 110]. <br>Moreover, preservice experiences will need to help teachers develop explicit <br>ways to bring the crosscutting concepts into focus as they teach disciplinary con-<br>tent ideas. In effect, the framework calls for using a common language across <br>grade levels for both scientific and engineering practices and crosscutting concepts. <br>Engaging teachers in using this language during their preparation experiences is <br>one strategy for ensuring that they develop facility and comfort with using it in <br>the classroom. <br>The practices of obtaining, representing, communicating, and presenting <br>information pose a particular challenge.

This may be particularly the <br>case for the preparation of elementary teachers, who are typically required to take <br>only a limited number of science courses and a single science methods course. <br>A variety of mechanisms for integrating these elements will probably need to be <br>considered, including modification of courses, addition of courses, and changes in <br>licensing requirements. Any such redesigns should be oriented to the framework’s <br>three dimensions while incorporating research-based knowledge of what is most <br>effective in teacher preparation. <br>Inservice Professional Development<br>Preservice preparation alone cannot fully prepare science teachers to implement <br>the three dimensions of the framework as an integrated and effective whole. <br>Inservice professional development will also be necessary to support teachers as <br>they move into classrooms and teach science education curricula based on the <br>framework [19, 112] and to introduce current teachers to the elements of the <br>framework and the teaching practices that are needed to support them. Science-<br>specific induction, and mentoring, and ongoing professional development for <br>teachers at all stages of their careers, are needed. <br>This professional development should not only be rich in scientific and engi-<br>neering practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas but also be <br>closely linked to teachers’ classroom practices and needs [113]. Such professional <br>development will thus need to be closely tied to the standards and curricula spe-<br>cific to the school, district, and state in which a particular teacher is teaching [64]. <br>This burden will fall at local and state levels, but the capacity to meet it could be <br>improved by coordinated development of teacher inservice programs capable of <br>serving multiple states that choose to adopt the same set of standards.

Some exploration of alternate mod-<br>els of teacher assignment, particularly at the upper elementary and middle school <br>grades, may be needed. Even for secondary science teachers, facility with concep-<br>tual understanding of the framework [115, 116] and with the practices described <br>here [80, 117] will require continuing professional development.<br>It should be understood that effective implementation of the new standards <br>may require ongoing professional development support and that this support may <br>look different from earlier versions. For example, the use of technology-facilitated <br>approaches—such as teachers’ video clubs to study their practices collaboratively <br>[118] or the use of geospatial or modeling technology—while rare today, may <br>become commonplace [119].<br>ASSESSMENT<br>Assessment refers to the means used to measure the outcomes of curriculum and <br>instruction—the achievements of students with regard to important competencies. <br>Assessment may include formal methods, such as large-scale standardized state <br>testing, or less formal classroom-based procedures, such as quizzes, class projects, <br>and teacher questioning.

All rights reserved.<br>261<br>Implementation: Curriculum, Instruction, Teacher Development, and Assessment<br>Purposes of Assessments<br>As discussed in Knowing What Students Know [1], there are at least three pur-<br>poses for educational assessment: <br>1.	 Formative assessment for use in the classroom to assist learning. Such <br>assessment is designed to provide diagnostic feedback to teachers and <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFC6FF;" title="Chunk 287 | Start: 646660 | End: 649125 | Tokens: 505">students during the course of instruction. Teachers need assessment infor-<br>mation about their individual students to guide the instructional process.<br>2.	 Summative assessment for use at the classroom, school, or district level <br>to determine student attainment levels. Such assessment includes tests, <br>given at the end of a unit or a school year, that are designed to determine <br>what individual students have achieved.<br>3.	 Assessment for program evaluation, used in making comparisons across <br>classrooms, schools, districts, states, or nations. Such assessment often <br>includes standardized tests designed to measure variation in the outcomes <br>of different instructional programs. <br>Schools, districts, and states typically employ assessments for all three pur-<br>poses and sometimes today for a fourth purpose—evaluation of teacher effective-<br>ness. Often the multiple forms of assessment have been designed separately and <br>may not be well aligned with each other [3]. But just as the education system as a <br>whole needs to function coherently to support implementation of the framework <br>and related standards, the multiple forms of assessment need to function coher-<br>ently as well. That is, the various forms of assessment should all be linked to the <br>shared goals outlined by the framework and related standards while at the same <br>time be designed to achieve the specific purpose at hand. <br>In addition, designers of assessments need to consider the diverse back-<br>grounds that students bring with them to science class. For example, from an anal-<br>ysis of the language demands faced by English language learners on science per-<br>formance assessments, Shaw, Bunch, and Geaney [120] concluded that assessment <br>developers need to eliminate barriers of language, gender-biased examples, and <br>other forms of representation that preclude some students’ useful participation.<br>More fundamentally, the education system currently lacks sophistication in <br>understanding and addressing the different purposes of assessment and how they <br>relate to each other and to the standards for a particular subject. For example, a <br>glaring and frequent mistake is to assume that current standardized tests of the type <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>262<br>used by most states to assess academic achievement for accountability purposes <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFADAD;" title="Chunk 288 | Start: 649125 | End: 651451 | Tokens: 498">can also suffice to fulfill the other purposes of assessment. Such a “one-size-fits-all” <br>notion of assessment is demonstrably inadequate. No single assessment, regardless <br>of how well it might be designed, can possibly meet the range of information needs <br>that operate from the classroom level on up [1, 3]. <br>Assessment Contexts: Classroom and Large-Scale Uses<br>In addition to differences in purpose, there are differences among assessments <br>(and similarities) in their contexts of use, which range from the classroom level <br>to the national level. As discussed in the NRC report Assessment in Support of <br>Instruction and Learning: Bridging the Gap Between Large-Scale and Classroom <br>Assessment [121], there are many desirable design features that should be shared <br>by assessments, whether intended for use at the classroom level (for formative or <br>summative purposes) or intended for large-scale use by states and nations (typical-<br>ly for accountability purposes). There are also some unique design characteristics <br>that apply separately to each context. Many of the desirable design characteristics, <br>shared or unique (to each context of use) alike, are currently unmet by the current <br>generation of science assessment tools and resources. <br>Most science assessments, whether intended for classroom or large-scale use, <br>still employ paper-and-pencil presentation and response formats that are amenable <br>only to limited forms of problem types. In fact, most large-scale tests are composed <br>primarily of selected-response (multiple-choice) tasks, and the situation is often <br>not much better at the classroom level. Assessments of this type can measure some <br>kinds of conceptual knowledge, and they also can provide a snapshot of some sci-<br>ence practices. But they do not adequately measure other kinds of achievements, <br>such as the formulation of scientific explanations or communication of scientific <br>understanding [122]. They also cannot assess students’ ability to design and execute <br>all of the steps involved in carrying out a scientific investigation [4] or engaging <br>in scientific argumentation. A few states have developed standardized classroom <br>assessments of science practices by providing uniform kits of materials that students <br>use to carry out laboratory tasks; this approach has also been used in the National <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFD6A5;" title="Chunk 289 | Start: 651451 | End: 653820 | Tokens: 509">Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) science test.

And <br>they must provide evidence that students can apply their knowledge appropriately <br>and are building on their existing knowledge and skills in ways that lead to deeper <br></span><span style="background-color: #FDFFB6;" title="Chunk 290 | Start: 653820 | End: 656265 | Tokens: 509">understanding of the scientific and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts, <br>and disciplinary core ideas. Science assessments must address all of these peda-<br>gogical goals while also meeting professional educators’ standards for reliability, <br>validity, and fairness. <br>Although we have distinguished three purposes of assessment and different <br>contexts of use, quality instruments for each purpose and context depend on the <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

An assessment designed to provide information about <br>students’ difficulties with a single concept so that it can be addressed with instruc-<br>tion would be designed differently from an assessment meant to provide informa-<br>tion to policy makers for evaluating the effectiveness of the overall education sys-<br>tem.

However, <br>guidance to states for developing a coherent system of assessments can be found in <br>the NRC report Systems for State Science Assessment [3]. <br>SUMMARY<br>As this chapter’s discussion suggests, the committee’s work on the framework and <br>resulting standards is only the beginning. In order for students to experience and <br>engage in the opportunities needed for understanding the three dimensions of sci-<br>entific and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas <br>described in the framework, many other players and components of the system <br>will need to change, often in dramatic ways. And these changes will need to occur <br>in parallel, driven by a common vision, as well as iteratively, because each affects <br></span><span style="background-color: #CAFFBF;" title="Chunk 291 | Start: 656265 | End: 658745 | Tokens: 498">the capacity of other components of the system to implement the framework and <br>standards. It is the committee’s vision that the framework and standards based on <br>it can help drive ongoing evolutionary change in science instruction through paral-<br>lel and interlocking developments across the multiple components of the system. <br>Curriculum developers will need to design K-12 science curricula based on <br>research and on learning progressions across grade levels that incorporate the <br>framework’s three dimensions. Teacher preparation programs and professional <br>development programs will need to provide learning opportunities for teachers <br>themselves in order to deepen their conceptual understanding, engage in scientific <br>and engineering practices, and develop an appreciation of science as a way of <br>knowing in a community of knowledge builders. These programs will also need to <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

College science departments will need to attend to the needs of pro-<br>spective science teachers. Assessment developers will need to develop creative, <br>valid, and reliable ways of gathering evidence about students’ progress across <br>the domains and grade levels to satisfy different purposes at different levels of <br>the science education system.<br>Furthermore, because these changes are needed across the entire science <br>education system—involving not only the educators at the front lines but also <br>those who make and implement policies—professional development for state-<br>level science supervisors, school boards, district-level leaders, principals, and <br>curriculum specialists will be necessary as well. In that way, all components and <br>players in the science education system can mesh coherently with the frame-<br>work’s vision for a more inclusive, focused, and authentic science education <br>experience for all students. <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Because schools face many constraints and persistent <br>challenges in delivering this broad mandate for all students, one crucial role of a <br>framework and its subject matter standards is to help ensure and evaluate educa-<br>tional equity. In the committee’s judgment, concerns about equity should be at the <br>forefront of any effort to improve the goals, structures, and practices that support <br>learning and educational attainment for all students. See Box 11-1 for a discussion <br>of different interpretations of equity. <br>In this chapter, we highlight equity issues that relate to students’ educational <br></span><span style="background-color: #BDB2FF;" title="Chunk 310 | Start: 689841 | End: 692305 | Tokens: 505">experiences and outcomes in science and engineering. We argue that the conclu-<br>sions and principles developed here should be used to inform any effort to define <br>and promote standards for science and engineering education. Issues related to <br>equity and diversity become even more important when standards are translated <br>into curricular and instructional materials and assessments.<br>SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING LEARNING FOR ALL<br>Promoting scientific literacy among all of the nation’s people is a democratic <br>ideal worthy of focused attention, significant resources, and continuing effort. <br>To help achieve that end, the committee thinks not only that standards should <br>reflect high academic goals for all students’ science and engineering learning—as <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Such issues <br>as human health, environmental conservation, transportation, food production <br>and safety, and energy production and consumption require fluency with the core <br>concepts and practices of science and engineering. As McDermott and Weber [1] <br>point out, a major goal for science education should be to provide all students <br>with the background to systematically investigate issues related to their personal <br>and community priorities. They should be able to frame scientific questions perti-<br>nent to their interests, conduct investigations and seek out relevant scientific argu-<br>ments and data, review and apply those arguments to the situation at hand, and <br>communicate their scientific understanding and arguments to others. <br>Students could go yet further, because a growing number of important <br>occupations in the 21st century—including those in expanding fields of science, <br>technology, engineering, and mathematics as well as in many other segments of <br>the workforce—will make use of the practices of scientific analyses, argumenta-<br>tion, communication, and engineering design. Providing more equitable access <br>to the knowledge and practices associated with science- and engineering-related <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFC6FF;" title="Chunk 311 | Start: 692305 | End: 694701 | Tokens: 499">occupations requires a more equitable achievement of science and engineering <br>WHAT IS EQUITY?<br>The term “equity” has been used in different ways by different communities of researchers and educators. Equity <br>as an expression of socially enlightened self-interest is reflected in calls to invest in the science and engineering <br>education of underrepresented groups simply because American labor needs can no longer be met by recruiting <br>among the traditional populations. Equity as an expression of social justice is manifested in calls to remedy the <br>injustices visited on entire groups of American society that in the past have been underserved by their schools <br>and have thereby suffered severely limited prospects of high-prestige careers in science and engineering. Other <br>notions of equity are expressed throughout the education literature; all are based on the commonsense idea of <br>fairness—what is inequitable is unfair. Fairness is sometimes considered to mean offering equal opportunity to <br>all. The most commonly used definition of equity, as influenced by the U.S. Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board of <br>Education (1954, 1955) and Lau v. Nichols (1974), frames equity in terms of equal treatment of all.<br>BOX 11-1 <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

All students should be able to learn about the broad set of pos-<br>sibilities that modern life offers and to pursue their aspirations, including their <br>occupations of interest. <br>Considering Sources of Inequity<br>Today there are profound differences among specific demographic groups in <br>their educational achievements and patterns of science learning, as in other sub-<br>ject matter areas. The reasons for these differences are complex, and research-<br>ers and educators have advanced a variety of explanations. We cannot address <br>all of them in this chapter, so we focus instead on two key areas. The first links <br>differences in achievement to differences in opportunities to learn because of <br>inequities across schools, districts, and communities. The second considers how <br>approaches to instruction can be made more inclusive and motivating for diverse <br>student populations. <br>Other sources of inequity that are important but beyond the scope of this <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFADAD;" title="Chunk 312 | Start: 694701 | End: 697191 | Tokens: 511">chapter are nevertheless important to keep in mind. For example, low learning <br>expectations and biased stereotypical views about the interests or abilities of <br>particular students or demographic groups also contribute, in both subtle and <br>overt ways, to their curtailed educational experiences and inequitable learning <br>supports [4-6]. Students’ own motivation and interest in science and engineering <br>can also play a role in their achievement and pursuit of these fields in secondary <br>school and beyond. Thus attention to factors that may motivate or fail to moti-<br>vate students from particular demographic groups is important to keep in mind <br>when designing instruction.<br>Students’ preparation in other subjects, especially literacy and mathemat-<br>ics, also affects their achievement in science. If some groups of students fail to <br>become effective readers and writers by late elementary school, teachers have <br>difficulty helping them to make progress—not only in science but also across all <br>subject areas. These students fall further behind, and the problem for teachers <br>grows more complex and challenging. Such dynamics can, in effect, reinforce the <br>low-expectation tracking of students as they move through school, thereby sig-<br>nificantly reducing their access to science and engineering pathways through K-12 <br>and limiting the possibility of their going to college. <br>Students’ Capacity to Learn Science<br>But can all students aspire to the science and engineering learning goals outlined <br>in the framework? Psychological and anthropological studies of human learning <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

As we <br>detail in the next section, a growing set of studies in science education show a <br>similar consensus that students—from across social classes and other demographic <br>groupings—can learn science when provided with supportive conditions to learn <br>over an extended period [9-12]. Significant and persistent achievement gaps in <br>science do exist on national and state assessments for low-income and minority <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFD6A5;" title="Chunk 313 | Start: 697191 | End: 699602 | Tokens: 502">students, but these outcomes should not be seen as stemming from an inability of <br>some students to be capable of engaging in sophisticated learning. <br>Educational standards should therefore establish science and engineering <br>learning goals that reflect common expectations for all students. Just as they are <br>expected to learn how to read and write, they should also be expected to learn the <br>core ideas and practices of science and engineering.<br>EQUALIZING OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN<br>Science and engineering are growing in their societal importance, yet access to a <br>high-quality education in science and engineering remains determined in large part <br>by an individual’s socioeconomic class, racial or ethnic group, gender, language <br>background, disability designation, or national origin. As summarized by Banks <br>et al.: “Being born into a racial majority group with high levels of economic and <br>social resources—or into a group that has historically been marginalized with low <br>levels of economic and social resources—results in very different lived experiences <br>that include unequal learning opportunities, challenges, and potential risks for <br>learning and development” [9]. Many students from lower socioeconomic strata <br>enter formal schooling with smaller academic vocabularies [13], have less access to <br>organized extracurricular activities and supplemental supports [14], and have less <br>social capital mobilized on their behalf than their more economically advantaged <br>peers [15]. Given the expectations of schooling, these differences pose numerous <br>❚ All individuals, with a small number of notable exceptions, can <br>engage in and learn complex subject matter . . . when supportive <br>conditions and feedback mechanisms are in place and the learner <br>makes a sustained effort. ❚<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

High school <br></span><span style="background-color: #FDFFB6;" title="Chunk 314 | Start: 699602 | End: 702030 | Tokens: 505">dropout rates are disproportionately high for these same groups. Girls’ interest in <br>science dramatically declines compared with boys’ as students transition into mid-<br>dle school, and women continue to be underrepresented in a number of science <br>and engineering fields and on the science and engineering faculties of many colleg-<br>es and universities. The causes of these differences in educational achievement and <br>professional attainment are multiple, explanations for them are somewhat contest-<br>ed, and in many ways they are the result of complex developmental processes that <br>are difficult to study [15]. But one perspective on how these achievement differen-<br>tials occur is to understand that they often result from “resource gaps” or gaps in <br>“opportunities to learn” [16, 17]. <br>Arguably, the most pressing challenge facing U.S. education is to provide all <br>students with a fair opportunity to learn [17-19]. Many schools lack the material <br>resources and instructional supports needed to provide exemplary science instruction <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>282<br>to all students on a regular basis. For example, in a survey of California teachers, 54 <br>percent stated that they were indeed in that situation [20]. The study indicated that <br>such shortages were more likely at schools that served high percentages of students <br>at risk of low academic performance. These same schools were also more likely <br>to have teachers who were uncredentialed or asked to teach outside their field of <br>expertise. While science or engineering institutions can help nearby schools provide <br>high-quality learning experiences for their students (e.g., with experts from industry <br>who visit the classroom, student trips to science centers and aquariums, teacher par-<br>ticipation in university programs), access to these assets cannot overcome the effects <br>of inequitable in-school resources across the breadth of schools, and indeed they can <br>reinforce those effects. The development of common and rigorous standards for use <br>with all students rests on the assumption that all students are provided with similar <br>learning opportunities.<br>Over the past decade, accountability pressures—generated by the focus on <br>student achievement as measured by high-stakes assessments—have heightened <br></span><span style="background-color: #CAFFBF;" title="Chunk 315 | Start: 702030 | End: 704510 | Tokens: 505">the curricular emphasis on mathematics and English/language arts and lowered <br>attention to (and investment in) science, art, and social studies—especially at the <br>elementary school level. In another California study—this one involving elementa-<br>ry school teachers in nine San Francisco Bay area counties—participants indicated <br>that science is the subject area in which they felt the most need of professional <br>development [21]. They also reported that they taught science less than one hour <br>per week on average across the elementary school grades—with science instruction <br>being more prevalent in the upper elementary grades than in the K-2 grade band. <br>In schools serving the most academically at-risk students, there is today an <br>almost total absence of science in the early elementary grades. This is particularly <br>problematic, given the emerging consensus that opportunities for science learning <br>and personal identification with science—as exemplified in this framework—are <br>long-term developmental processes that need sustained cultivation. In other words, <br>the lack of science instruction in early elementary school grades may mean that <br>only students with sources of support for science learning outside school are being <br>brought into that long-term developmental process; this gap initiates inequalities <br>that are difficult to remediate in later schooling. This state of affairs is ironic in <br>that students in the early elementary school grades are often deeply attracted to <br>❚ Arguably, the most pressing challenge facing U.S. education is to <br>provide all students with a fair opportunity to learn. ❚<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Furthermore, for students with limited language <br>skills, the absence of opportunities to engage in science learning deprives them of <br>a rich opportunity for language development that goes beyond basic vocabulary.<br>To help resolve the problems noted above, standards should (a) highlight <br>that rigorous learning goals are appropriate for all students and (b) make explicit <br>the associated assumptions about instructional time, equipment and materials, and <br>teacher knowledge needed for all students to achieve these goals. That information <br></span><span style="background-color: #9BF6FF;" title="Chunk 316 | Start: 704510 | End: 707031 | Tokens: 503">would help educators at the state, regional, and district levels make detailed plans <br>and allocate resources in order to equalize students’ opportunities to learn science <br>and engineering in the ways described in the standards. <br>INCLUSIVE SCIENCE INSTRUCTION<br>Inclusive instructional strategies encompass a range of techniques and approaches <br>that build on students’ interests and backgrounds so as to engage them more <br>meaningfully and support them in sustained learning. These strategies, which also <br>have been shown to promote educational equity in learning science and engineer-<br>ing, must be attended to as standards are translated into curriculum, instruction, <br>and assessment.<br>As we have discussed throughout this report, the framework reflects the <br>fact that students learn science in large part through their active involvement in <br>the practices of science. A classroom environment that provides opportunities for <br>students to participate in scientific and engineering practices engages them in tasks <br>that require social interaction, the use of scientific discourse (that leverages com-<br>munity discourse when possible), and the application of scientific representations <br>and tools. Science and engineering practices can actually serve as productive entry <br>points for students from diverse communities—including students from different <br>social and linguistic traditions, particularly second-language learners. Tailored <br>instructional perspectives and additional approaches, as we outline in the follow-<br>ing sections, may be needed to engage these and other students in the full range of <br>practices described in Chapter 4. <br>Approaching Science Learning as a Cultural Accomplishment<br>All science learning can be understood as a cultural accomplishment. Children and <br>adults the world over explore their surroundings and converse about the seem-<br>ing causes and consequences of the phenomena they observe, but they are raised <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>284<br>in environments with varied exposures to activities (e.g., fishing, farming, com-<br>puting) that relate to different science and engineering domains. What counts as <br>learning and what types of knowledge are seen as important are closely tied to a <br>community’s values and what is useful in that community context [22-25]. <br>Science has been described as being “heavily dependent on cultural contexts, <br></span><span style="background-color: #A0C4FF;" title="Chunk 317 | Start: 707031 | End: 709326 | Tokens: 498">power relationships, value systems, ideological dogma, and human emotional <br>needs” [26]. Although this view is a contested one, seeing science as “a culturally <br>mediated way of thinking and knowing suggests that learning can be defined as <br>engagement with scientific practices” [27]. When people enter into the practices <br>of science or engineering, they do not leave their cultural worldviews at the door. <br>Instruction that fails to recognize this reality can adversely affect student engage-<br>ment in science. Calabrese Barton therefore argues for allowing science and sci-<br>ence understanding to grow out of lived experiences [28]. In doing so, people <br>“remove the binary distinction from doing science or not doing science and being <br>in science or being out of science, [thereby allowing] connections between [learn-<br>ers’] life worlds and science to be made more easily [and] providing space for mul-<br>tiple voices to be heard and explored” [28]. This view is very powerful when one <br>considers how best to engage all youth in the learning of science. Everyday expe-<br>rience provides a rich base of knowledge and experience to support conceptual <br>changes in science. Students bring cultural <br>funds of knowledge that can be leveraged, <br>combined with other concepts, and trans-<br>formed into scientific concepts over time.<br>Everyday contexts and situations that <br>are important in children’s lives not only <br>influence their repertoires of practice but <br>also are likely to support their develop-<br>ment of complex cognitive skills. This is <br>evident in the studies of activities described <br>as meaningful by individuals from vari-<br>ous American cultures [29-36]. Teachers <br>pursuing a culturally responsive approach <br>to instruction will need to understand the <br>sense-making practices of particular com-<br>munities, the science-related values that <br>reside in them, and the historical relationship that exists between the commu-<br>nity and local institutions of education. Instruction can then be crafted to reflect <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

As one example, Tzou and Bell [40] describe a curriculum effort that <br>redesigned an elementary science kit to focus on the local cultural practices that <br>related to the central subject matter in the unit. This involved a shift in students <br>inquiring into a range of microworlds to investigations of the microbiology of <br>local community health practices [40]. Fifth-grade students helped to photo docu-<br>ment the everyday connections to the science content and were then supported in <br>investigating issues of personal interest. In another case, Luehmann engaged mid-<br>dle school girls in extended scientific investigations and sense-making on topics of <br>their own choosing in an after-school science context [41]. Students were able to <br>develop science-linked identities by realizing that science could be meaningfully <br>related to circumstances of their own lives, which they could then investigate [41]. <br>In many cases, a culturally responsive approach to science instruction involves the <br>recognition of community practices and knowledge as being central to the scien-<br>tific endeavor [42].<br>Relating Youth Discourses to Scientific Discourses<br>Many equity-focused interventions have leveraged the discourse (i.e., sense-<br>making) practices of youth to productively engage them in the language and dis-<br>course styles of science and in the learning of science. While traditional classroom <br>practices have been found to be successful for students whose discourse practices <br>at home resemble those at school—mainly students from middle-class and upper-<br>middle-class European/American homes [43]—this approach does not work very <br>well for individuals from historically nondominant groups. For these students, tra-<br>ditional classroom practices function as a gatekeeper, barring them because their <br>community’s sense-making practices may not be acknowledged [38, 44-46].<br>Recognizing that language and discourse patterns vary across culturally <br>diverse groups, researchers point to the importance of accepting, even encourag-<br>ing, students’ classroom use of informal or native language and familiar modes <br>of interaction [47-49]. The research literature contains multiple examples. Lee <br>and Fradd [47] noted distinct patterns of discourse (e.g., use of simultaneous <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFC6FF;" title="Chunk 319 | Start: 711679 | End: 714115 | Tokens: 500">or sequential speech) around science topics in groups of students from different <br>backgrounds. Rosebery, Warren, and Conant [50] identified connections between <br>Haitian Creole students’ storytelling skills and their approaches to argumentation <br>and science inquiry; they used those connections to support their learning of both <br>the content and the practices of science. Hudicourt-Barnes demonstrated how bay <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>286<br>odyans—the Haitian argumentative discussion style—could be a great resource for <br>students as they practice science and scientific discourse [51]. <br>As these studies indicate, diverse linguistic practices for making sense of <br>natural phenomena can generate learning and be leveraged in instruction [9, 46, <br>50]. Brown has recently extended this line of work by developing an instructional <br>model that helps students bridge the transition from using their vernacular lan-<br>guage for scientific phenomena to using disciplinary terminology and forms of dis-<br>course; essentially, they describe and discuss the same phenomena in both modes <br>in turn [46]. The challenge for teachers is to know enough about their students’ <br>relevant linguistic practices to be able to support this transition in the classroom.<br>A classroom rich in discourse is also a classroom that offers particular chal-<br>lenges for students still learning English. On the other side of the coin, engagement <br>in the discourse and practices of science, built as it is around observations and <br>evidence, also offers not only science learning but also a rich language-learning <br>opportunity for such students. For both reasons, inclusion in classroom discourse <br>and engagement in science practices can be particularly valuable for such students.<br>Building on Prior Interest and Identity<br>Research suggests that personal interest is an important factor in children’s <br>involvement in learning science [52, 53]. Educational experiences designed to <br>leverage the personal interests of learners have been used to increase the participa-<br>tion of girls in middle school [41], of urban high school youth of color [28], and <br>of elementary school children from immigrant families [40]. Tai and colleagues’ <br>nationally representative study of factors associated with science career choices <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFADAD;" title="Chunk 320 | Start: 714115 | End: 716572 | Tokens: 499">suggested that an expressed interest in science during early adolescence is a strong <br>predictor of science degree attainment [54]. But even though early interest in sci-<br>ence does not guarantee extended learning in science, early engagement can trig-<br>ger students’ motivation to explore the broader educational landscape and pursue <br>additional experiences that may persist throughout life.<br>Learning science depends not only on the accumulation of facts and con-<br>cepts but also on the development of an identity as a competent learner of sci-<br>ence with motivation and interest to learn more. As Lave and Wenger explain, <br>“Learning involves the construction of identities. [It is] an evolving form of mem-<br>bership” [55]. Such identity formation is valuable not only for the small number <br>of students who, over the course of a lifetime, will come to view themselves as <br>scientists or engineers but also for the great majority of students who do not fol-<br>low these professional paths. Science learning in school leads to citizens with the <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>287<br>Equity and Diversity in Science and Engineering Education<br>confidence, ability, and inclination to continue learning about issues, scientific and <br>otherwise, that affect their lives and communities. <br>For these reasons, instruction that builds on prior interest and identity is <br>likely to be as important as instruction that builds on knowledge alone. All stu-<br>dents can profit from this approach, but the benefits are particularly salient for <br>those who would feel disenfranchised or disconnected from science should instruc-<br>tion neglect their personal inclinations. <br>Leveraging Students’ Cultural Funds of Knowledge<br>Particular cultural groups frequently develop systematic knowledge of the natu-<br>ral world through their members’ participation in informal learning experiences, <br>which are influenced by the groups’ history and values and the demands of spe-<br>cific settings [12]. Such culturally influenced ways of approaching nature reflect <br>a diversity of perspectives that should be recognized in designing science learning <br>experiences. Although some kinds of culturally valued knowledge and practices <br>(including spiritual and mystical thought, folk narratives, and various accounts <br>of creation) are at odds with science, a growing body of published research, <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFD6A5;" title="Chunk 321 | Start: 716572 | End: 718935 | Tokens: 505">briefly described below, shows that some of the knowledge derived from varied <br>cultures and contexts provides valid and consistent scientific interpretations. <br>This literature includes evidence from cultural psychology, anthropology, and <br>education [12]. <br>An emerging consensus in education scholarship is that the diverse knowl-<br>edge and skills that members of different cultural groups bring to formal and <br>informal science learning contexts are assets to build on [9, 12]. For example, <br>researchers have documented that children reared in rural agricultural communi-<br>ties, who have regular and often intense interactions with plants and animals, <br>develop a more sophisticated understanding of the natural world than do urban <br>and suburban children of the same age [56]. Other researchers have identified con-<br>nections between children’s culturally based stories and the scientific arguments <br>they are capable of making [50, 57]. Such research suggests that educators should <br>accept, even enlist, diversity as a means of enhancing science learning [58].<br>❚ Learning science depends not only on the accumulation of facts and <br>concepts but also on the development of an identity as a competent <br>learner of science with motivation and interest to learn more. ❚<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>288<br>MAKING DIVERSITY VISIBLE<br>Prior educational standards in science education [19] have been criticized because <br>their well-intentioned equity goals were advanced in general terms and the specific <br>circumstances, both historical and contemporary, of various cultural groups were <br>not identified, which made them difficult to understand and act on [59]. Nor were <br>acknowledgments made of the specific contribu-<br>tions of members from diverse cultures to scien-<br>tific and technological enterprises. <br>We now know, as discussed in the pre-<br>vious section, that the pursuit of equity in <br>education requires detailed attention to the <br>circumstances of specific demographic groups <br>[9, 60-62]. When appropriate and relevant to <br>the science issue at hand, standards documents <br>should explicitly represent the cultural particu-<br>lars of diverse learning populations throughout <br>the text (e.g., in referenced examples, sample <br></span><span style="background-color: #FDFFB6;" title="Chunk 322 | Start: 718935 | End: 721401 | Tokens: 508">vignettes, performance expectations). Similarly, <br>an effort should be made to include significant <br>contributions of women and of people from <br>diverse cultures and ethnicities. We acknowledge <br>the challenge of creating a set of standards that attempts to represent all salient <br>cultural groups, but that should not be an excuse for excluding them all. <br>The goal of making diversity visible is also desirable at a more abstract <br>theoretical level. Educational standards always embody one or more theoretical <br>perspectives on how people learn, how educators should teach, and how equity <br>should be pursued—some or all of which may not be made explicit in the stan-<br>dards’ documents. Such documents in the future should instead be transparent <br>about their underlying theoretical perspectives related to diversity, equity, and <br>social justice. This will help the reader to understand the salience of these issues <br>in the teaching of science and in standards-based efforts to improve science edu-<br>cation for all students. <br>❚ The diverse knowledge and skills that members of different cultural <br>groups bring to formal and informal science learning contexts are assets <br>to build on. ❚<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>289<br>Equity and Diversity in Science and Engineering Education<br>VALUE MULTIPLE MODES OF EXPRESSION<br>How school systems evaluate the learning derived from educational standards—<br>through high-stakes tests, formative classroom assessments, and informal evalua-<br>tions of learning during instruction—has a driving influence on educational path-<br>ways and equity. Exemplary assessment practice recognizes that there are multiple <br>ways in which students might express their developing understanding, although <br>not all forms of assessment allow for such multiple modes of expression. <br>Indeed, an enduring concern is that tests may not accurately gauge what <br>students have learned [63]. A core problem is that the tests often do not make use <br>of contemporary views of learning and cognition and thereby fail to assess higher <br>order skills or conceptual understanding. Another important problem is that <br>tests can be culturally biased, especially for some of the most vulnerable popula-<br>tions. Students whose first language is not English can find it difficult to express <br>what they know on assessment instruments written in English. And an extensive <br></span><span style="background-color: #CAFFBF;" title="Chunk 323 | Start: 721401 | End: 723872 | Tokens: 509">literature highlights how “stereotype threat” can negatively affect the cognitive <br>performance of girls and students from particular demographic groups during <br>high-stakes assessments [64]. In order to help ensure educational equity, specific <br>strategies need to be employed to guard against such unintended and undesirable <br>assessment-based underestimations of student understanding. The representation <br>of performance expectations in the standards document provides an opportunity <br>to address these issues. <br>Such concerns, however, go beyond standards and need to address the condi-<br>tions under which assessments are given. For example, authentic assessments may <br>allow students to edit their rough drafts in much the same way that scientists and <br>engineers circulate initial findings to colleagues before submitting a final draft for <br>public consumption. But open-ended or extended-response items on high-stakes <br>state assessments often demand that students provide what is essentially a “first <br>draft” of a performance. For students who need to take more time to express their <br>understanding (e.g., if they learned English as their second language), opportuni-<br>ties to edit or to display their knowledge in less language-embedded tasks would <br>help level the playing field. It is worth noting that current efforts in assessment for <br>mathematics and language arts are moving in this direction by including embed-<br>ded performance assessments in curricula and aggregating them with summative <br>assessments to create broader assessments of student learning [65]. <br>Performance on assessments is affected by context as well as content [6, 64], <br>and this can also have cultural roots. For example, work by Deyhle suggests that <br>many American Indian communities do not socialize their children to making the <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>290<br>public displays of achievement that are required in schools [66]. As Delpit has <br>argued, this suggests the importance of making explicit the norms not only of class-<br>room participation but also of assessment [67]. When defining performance expec-<br>tations in standards documents to be used for formative and high-stakes assessment, <br>standards developers should highlight how students can demonstrate competence <br>through multiple means of expression and in multiple contexts.<br></span><span style="background-color: #9BF6FF;" title="Chunk 324 | Start: 723872 | End: 725668 | Tokens: 509"><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

All rights reserved.<br>297<br>T<br>he preceding chapters of this report describe the scientific and engineering <br>practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas—taken together, <br>the framework—that should be the focus of K-12 science and engineering <br>education. In this chapter, we offer guidance for developing standards based on <br></span><span style="background-color: #A0C4FF;" title="Chunk 333 | Start: 739006 | End: 741486 | Tokens: 499">that framework. The committee recognizes that several layers of interpretation <br>occur between the outline articulated in the framework and actual instruction in <br>the classroom, with the first layer being the translation of the framework into a <br>set of standards. In this translation, it is important to keep in mind the possibili-<br>ties and constraints of K-12 science education in the United States and to consider <br>how standards can play a role in promoting coherence in science education—an <br>element that is critical to ensuring an effective science education for all students, <br>as discussed in Chapter 10 on implementation.<br>The emphasis on coherence includes consistency across standards for dif-<br>ferent subject areas. Given the large number of states that have adopted the <br>Common Core Standards for mathematics and English/language arts, standards <br>for K-12 science intended for multistate adoption need to parallel the expectations <br>for development of mathematics and English/language arts competency reflected in <br>corresponding standards [1].<br>The framework is designed to support coherence across the science and <br>engineering education system by providing a template that incorporates what is <br>known about how children learn these subjects. The committee’s choice to orga-<br>nize the framework around the scientific and engineering practices, crosscutting <br>concepts, and disciplinary core ideas is intended to facilitate this coherence. By <br>GUIDANCE FOR STANDARDS DEVELOPERS<br>12<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>298<br>consistently focusing on these practices, concepts, and ideas and by drawing on <br>research to inform how they can be supported through instruction and developed <br>over multiple grades, the framework promotes cumulative learning for students, <br>coordinated learning experiences across years, more focused preparation and pro-<br>fessional development for teachers, and more coherent systems of assessment. <br>The committee recognizes that simply articulating the critical practices, <br>concepts, and core ideas for K-12 science education does not by itself provide <br>sufficient guidance for developing standards. In that spirit, the recommendations <br>outlined in this chapter are intended to offer more detailed guidance that will help <br>ensure fidelity to the framework. These recommendations are based on previous <br></span><span style="background-color: #BDB2FF;" title="Chunk 334 | Start: 741486 | End: 743950 | Tokens: 496">research syntheses published by the National Research Council (NRC)—including <br>How People Learn [2], Systems for State Science Assessment [3], Taking Science <br>to School [4], and Learning Science in Informal Environments [5]—and they draw <br>particularly on a list of characteristics for science content standards developed in <br>Systems for State Science Assessment [3]. According to that report, science content <br>standards should be clear, detailed, and complete; reasonable in scope; rigorously <br>and scientifically correct; and based on sound models of student learning. These <br>standards should also have a clear conceptual framework, describe performance <br>expectations, and identify proficiency levels.<br>RECOMMENDATIONS<br>Recommendation 1: Standards should set rigorous learning goals that repre-<br>sent a common expectation for all students. <br>At a time when nearly every aspect of human life is shaped by science and <br>engineering, the need for all citizens to understand these fields is greater than <br>ever before. Although many reports have identified the urgent need for a stronger <br>workforce in science and engineering so that the United States may remain eco-<br>nomically competitive, the committee thinks that developing a scientifically liter-<br>ate citizenry is equally urgent. Thus the framework is designed to be a first step <br>toward a K-12 science education that will provide all students with experiences in <br>science that deepen their understanding and appreciation of scientific knowledge <br>and give them the foundation to pursue scientific or engineering careers if they <br>so choose. A growing evidence base demonstrates that students across economic, <br>social, and other demographic groupings can and do learn science when provided <br>with appropriate opportunities [4-7]. These opportunities include learning the req-<br>uisite literacy and numeracy skills required for science.<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>299<br>Guidance for Standards Developers<br>Because the committee proceeded on the assumption that the framework <br>and resulting standards identify those practices, crosscutting concepts, and dis-<br>ciplinary core ideas that are required for all students, some topics covered in <br>advanced or specialized courses may not be fully represented. That is, the frame-<br>work and resulting standards are not intended to represent all possible practices, <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFC6FF;" title="Chunk 335 | Start: 743950 | End: 746326 | Tokens: 493">concepts, and ideas covered in the full set of science courses offered through grade <br>12 (e.g., Advanced Placement or honors courses; technology courses; computer <br>science courses; and social, behavioral, or economic science courses). Rather, the <br>framework and standards represent the set of scientific and engineering practices, <br>concepts, and ideas that all students should encounter as they move through <br>required course sequences in the natural sciences.<br>Recommendation 2: Standards should be scientifically accurate yet also clear, <br>concise, and comprehensible to science educators.<br>Standards for K-12 science education (a) provide guidance to education pro-<br>fessionals about the priorities for science education and (b) articulate the learning <br>goals that must be pursued in curricula, instruction, and assessments. <br>Scientific rigor and accuracy are paramount because standards serve as ref-<br>erence points for other elements of the system. Thus any errors in the standards <br>are likely to be replicated in curricula, instruction, and assessments. Similarly, <br>standards should clearly describe the scientific practices in which students will <br>engage in classrooms [3]. Clarity is important because curriculum developers, text-<br>book and materials selection committees, assessment designers, and others need <br>to develop a shared understanding of the outcomes their efforts are intended to <br>promote [3].<br>At the same time, standards related to the framework’s concepts, ideas, <br>and practices must be described in language that is comprehensible to individu-<br>als who are not scientists. Even though some of the professionals who play a <br>role in interpreting standards do not have deep expertise in science, they nev-<br>ertheless need to develop ways to support students’ learning in science and to <br>determine whether students have met the standards. Standards also provide a <br>mechanism for communicating educational priorities to an even broader set <br>of stakeholders, including parents, community members, business people, and <br>policy leaders at the state and national levels. Thus, although standards need <br>to communicate accurately important scientific ideas and practices, they must <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Furthermore, the <br>broad goals and major intent should be clear to any reader.<br>Recommendation 3: Standards should be limited in number. <br>The framework focuses on a limited set of scientific and engineering practic-<br>es, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas, which were selected by using <br>the criteria developed by the framework committee (and outlined in Chapter 2) <br>as a filter. We also drew on previous reports, which recommended structuring <br>K-12 standards around core ideas as a means of focusing the K-12 science cur-<br>riculum [3, 4]. These reports’ recommendations emerged from analyses of existing <br>national, state, and local standards as well as from a synthesis of current research <br>on learning and teaching in science.<br>Standards developers should adhere to the framework by concentrating on <br>the set of practices, concepts, and core ideas described here, although undoubtedly <br>there will be pressure from stakeholder groups to expand that set. The above-men-<br>tioned criteria can be used in determining whether a proposed addition should be <br>accepted. An overarching consideration is whether all students need to learn the <br>proposed idea or practice and if there would be a significant deficiency in citizens’ <br>knowledge if it were not included. Another consideration should be recognition <br>of the modest amount of time allotted to science in the K-12 grades. There is a <br>limit to what can be attained in such time, and inclusion of additional elements of <br>a discipline will always be at the expense of other elements, whether of that disci-<br>pline or of another.<br>Recommendation 4: Standards should emphasize all three dimensions articu-<br>lated in the framework—not only crosscutting concepts and disciplinary core <br>ideas but also scientific and engineering practices. <br>The committee emphasized scientific and engineering practices for several <br>reasons. First, as discussed in Chapter 2, competency in science involves more <br>than knowing facts, and students learn key concepts in science more effectively <br>when they engage in these practices. Second, there is a body of knowledge <br>about science—for example, the nature of evidence, the role of models, the fea-<br>tures of a sound scientific argument—that is best acquired through engagement <br>in these practices. Third, emerging evidence suggests that offering opportunities <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFD6A5;" title="Chunk 337 | Start: 748733 | End: 751217 | Tokens: 495"><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>301<br>Guidance for Standards Developers<br>for students to engage in scientific and engineering practices increases participa-<br>tion of underrepresented minorities in science [8-12].<br>The importance of addressing both knowledge and practice is not unique to <br>this framework. In 1993, the Benchmarks for Science Literacy of the American <br>Association for the Advancement of Science provided standards for students’ <br>engagement in scientific inquiry [13]. In 1996, the National Science Education <br>Standards of the NRC emphasized five essential features of scientific inquiry [14]. <br>Two more recent NRC reports also recommended that students’ learning experi-<br>ences in science should provide them with opportunities to engage in specific prac-<br>tices [4, 5]. The contribution of this framework is the provision of a set of scientif-<br>ic and engineering practices that are appropriate for K-12 students and moreover <br>that reflect the practices routinely used by professional scientists.<br>Recommendation 5: Standards should include performance expectations that <br>integrate the scientific and engineering practices with the crosscutting concepts <br>and disciplinary core ideas. These expectations should include criteria for <br>identifying successful performance and require that students demonstrate an <br>ability to use and apply knowledge. <br>Chapter 9 further provides two examples of how performance expectations <br>for particular life science and physical science component ideas could be integrat-<br>ed with core ideas, as well as with concepts and practices, across the grades (see <br>Tables 9-1 and 9-2). <br>Developing performance expectations is a major task for standards develop-<br>ers, but it is an effort worth making; performance expectations and criteria for <br>successful performance are essential in order for standards to fulfill their role of <br>supporting assessment development and setting achievement standards [3]. An <br>exhaustive description of every performance level for every standard is unrealistic, <br>but at a minimum the performance expectations should describe the major criteria <br>of successful performance [3].<br>Recommendation 6: Standards should incorporate boundary statements. That <br>is, for a given core idea at a given grade level, standards developers should <br>include guidance not only about what needs to be taught but also about what <br></span><span style="background-color: #FDFFB6;" title="Chunk 338 | Start: 751217 | End: 753671 | Tokens: 507">does not need to be taught in order for students to achieve the standard. <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>302<br>By delimiting what is included in a given topic in a particular grade band <br>or grade level, boundary statements provide insights into the expected cur-<br>riculum and thus aid in its development by others. Boundary statements should <br>not add to the scope of the standards but rather should provide clear guidance <br>regarding expectations for students. Such boundaries should be viewed as flex-<br>ible and subject to modification over time, based on what is learned through <br>implementation in the classroom and through research. However, it is important <br>to begin with a set of statements that articulate the boundaries envisioned by <br>standards developers. <br>Boundary statements can signal where material that traditionally has been <br>included could instead be trimmed. For example, in the physical sciences, the pro-<br>gressions indicate that density is not stressed as a property of matter until the 6-8 <br>grade band; at present, it is often introduced earlier and consumes considerable <br>instructional time to little avail. Boundary statements may also help define which <br>technical definitions or descriptions could be dispensed with in a particular grade <br>band. Thus the boundary statements are a useful mechanism for narrowing the <br>material to be covered, even within the core idea topics, in order to provide time <br>for more meaningful development of ideas through engagement in practices. In <br>other words, being explicit about what should not be taught helps clarify what <br>should be taught. <br>Recommendation 7: Standards should be organized as sequences that support <br>students’ learning over multiple grades. They should take into account how <br>students’ command of the practices, concepts, and core ideas becomes more <br>sophisticated over time with appropriate instructional experiences. <br>As noted in the introduction, the framework is designed to help students <br>continually build on and revise their knowledge and abilities, starting from initial <br>conceptions about how the world works and their curiosity about what they see <br>around them. The framework’s goal is thus to provide students with opportunities <br>to learn about the practices, concepts, and core ideas, of science and engineering <br></span><span style="background-color: #CAFFBF;" title="Chunk 339 | Start: 753671 | End: 756041 | Tokens: 498">in successively more sophisticated ways over multiple years [4]. This perspective <br>should prompt educators to decide how topics ought to be presented at each grade <br>level so that they build on prior student learning and support continuing concep-<br>tual restructuring and refinement. <br>There is one overarching set of boundaries or constraints across the progres-<br>sions for the disciplinary core ideas. Early work in science begins by exploring <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>303<br>Guidance for Standards Developers<br>the visible and tangible macroscopic world. Then the domain of phenomena and <br>systems considered is broadened to those that students cannot directly see but that <br>still operate at the scales of human experience. Students then move to exploring <br>or envisioning things that are too small to see or too large to readily imagine, and <br>they are aided by models or specialized tools for measurement and imaging. <br>This overarching progression informs the grade band endpoints in the <br>framework. Grades K-2 focus on visible phenomena with which students are <br>likely to have some experience in their everyday lives or in the classroom. <br>Grades 3-5 explore macroscopic phenomena more deeply, including model-<br>ing processes and systems that are not visible. Grades 6-8 move to microscopic <br>phenomena and introduce atoms, molecules, and cells. Grades 9-12 move to <br>the subatomic level and to the consideration of complex interactions within and <br>among systems at all scales.<br>Recommendation 8: Whenever possible, the progressions in standards should <br>be informed by existing research on learning and teaching. In cases in which <br>insufficient research is available to inform a progression or in which there is <br>a lack of consensus on the research findings, the progression should be devel-<br>oped on the basis of a reasoned argument about learning and teaching. The <br>sequences described in the framework can be used as guidance. <br>Because research on these progressions is relatively recent, there is not a <br>robust evidence base about appropriate sequencing for every concept, core idea, <br>or practice identified in the framework. When evidence was available, the commit-<br>tee used it to guide the thinking about the progression in question. When evidence <br></span><span style="background-color: #9BF6FF;" title="Chunk 340 | Start: 756041 | End: 758406 | Tokens: 505">was not available, we made judgments based on the best knowledge available, <br>as supported by existing documents such as the NAEP 2009 Science Framework <br>[15], the College Board Standards for College Success [16], and the AAAS Atlas of <br>Science Literacy [17]. There is also a body of research on the intuitive understand-<br>ing that children bring to school and on how that intuitive knowledge influences <br>their learning of science [4]; this evidence base should be considered when devel-<br>oping standards. <br>Each progression described in the framework represents a particular vision <br>of one possible pathway by which students could come to understand a specific <br>core idea. The committee recognizes that there are many possible alternate paths <br>and also that there are interplays among the ideas that here are subdivided into <br>disciplines and component ideas within a discipline. In any case, progressions <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>304<br>developed in the standards should be based on the available research on learning, <br>an understanding of what is appropriate for students at a particular grade band <br>based on research and on educators’ professional experience, and logical infer-<br>ences about how learning might occur. <br>Recommendation 9: The committee recommends that the diverse needs of stu-<br>dents and of states be met by developing grade band standards as an overarch-<br>ing common set for adoption by multiple states. For those states that prefer <br>or require grade-by-grade standards, a suggested elaboration on grade band <br>standards could be provided as an example. <br>Given the incomplete nature of the evidence base, the committee could <br>not specify grade-by-grade steps in the progressions. Indeed, for some ideas <br>it was difficult just to develop research-based progressions at the grade band <br>level; in those cases, we relied on expert judgment and previous standards docu-<br>ments. And even if grade-by-grade standards were feasible, research has shown <br>that, within a particular grade, different students are often at different levels of <br>achievement; thus expectations that every student will reach understanding of a <br>core idea by the end of that grade may not be warranted. Across a grade band, <br></span><span style="background-color: #A0C4FF;" title="Chunk 341 | Start: 758406 | End: 760823 | Tokens: 505">however, students can continue to build on and develop core ideas over multiple <br>school years; by the end of the grade band, they are more likely to have reached <br>the levels of understanding intended.<br>In the committee’s judgment, grade band standards are also more appropri-<br>ate than grade-by-grade ones for systemic reasons, particularly for standards that <br>may be adopted and implemented in numerous states. Because schools across the <br>country vary both in their degree of organization, in their human and physical <br>resources, and in the topics they have traditionally included at various grades, a <br>national-level document’s universal and homogeneous prescription for grade-by-<br>grade standards may be too difficult for the schools in some states to meet, and <br>it would perhaps be inappropriate for those localities to begin with. By contrast, <br>specification by grade bands gives curriculum developers, states, districts, schools, <br>and teachers the professional autonomy to ensure that content can be taught in a <br>manner appropriate to the local context. This autonomy includes choosing from <br>various possible strategies for course sequences and course organization at the <br>middle and high school levels. <br>However, because it is recognized that many states require grade-by-grade <br>standards for K-8 and course standards at the high school level, an example set <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>305<br>Guidance for Standards Developers<br>of such standards may need to be provided. The intent of this recommendation is <br>that states or districts wishing to offer alternative course sequences and organiza-<br>tion at the high school level or alternative within grade band organization of con-<br>tent at the K-8 level can adopt the grade band standards.<br>This recommendation should not be interpreted as suggesting that students <br>in some areas need not or cannot learn particular topics until later grade levels, <br>but rather that the transition to a single common set of grade-by-grade standards <br>is perhaps more onerous for schools and districts in term of curriculum materials, <br>equipment, and teacher professional development needs than a transition to the <br>somewhat more flexible definition of sequence given by grade band standards.<br>Recommendation 10: If grade-by-grade standards are written based on the <br></span><span style="background-color: #BDB2FF;" title="Chunk 342 | Start: 760823 | End: 763237 | Tokens: 497">grade band descriptions provided in the framework, these standards should be <br>designed to provide a coherent progression within each grade band.<br>The content described in the framework is designed to be distributed over <br>each grade band in a manner that builds on previous learning and is not repetitive. <br>If standards developers choose to create grade-by-grade standards, it is necessary <br>that these standards provide clear articulation of the content across grades within <br>a band and attend to the progression of science learning from grade to grade with-<br>in the band. At the middle and high school levels, course standards and suggested <br>course sequences may be more appropriate than grade-level standards.<br>Recommendation 11: Any assumptions about the resources, time, and teach-<br>er expertise needed for students to achieve particular standards should be <br>made explicit.<br>In designing the framework, the committee tried to set goals for science edu-<br>cation that would not only improve its quality but also be attainable under cur-<br>rent resources and other constraints. In addition, the committee intended for the <br>framework’s goals to act as levers for much-needed improvement in how schools <br>are able to deliver high-quality science education to all students. For example, in <br>order to meet the goals for science education in the elementary grades, more time <br>may need to be devoted to science than is currently allocated. The committee rec-<br>ognizes as well that new curricula aligned to the framework will need to be devel-<br>oped and that professional development for teachers will need to be updated. <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>306<br>Standards developers should be cautious about limiting the rigor of stan-<br>dards in response to perceptions about the system’s constraints. Research clearly <br>demonstrates that all students have the capacity to learn science when motivated <br>to do so and provided with adequate opportunities to acquire the requisite literacy <br>and numeracy skills [4, 5]. Thus standards should catalyze change in the system <br>when necessary, motivating states, school districts, and schools to ensure that all <br>students have access to rich learning experiences.<br>Recommendation 12: The standards for the sciences and engineering should <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFC6FF;" title="Chunk 343 | Start: 763237 | End: 765669 | Tokens: 502">align coherently with those for other K-12 subjects. Alignment with the <br>Common Core Standards in mathematics and English/language arts is espe-<br>cially important.<br>As noted earlier, achieving coherence within the system is critical for ensur-<br>ing an effective science education for all students. An important aspect of coher-<br>ence is continuity across different subjects within a grade or grade band. By this <br>we mean “sensible connections and coordination [among] the topics that students <br>study in each subject within a grade and as they advance through the grades” [3, <br>p. 298]. The underlying argument is that coherence across subject areas contrib-<br>utes to increased student learning because it provides opportunities for reinforce-<br>ment and additional uses of practices in each area. <br>For example, students’ writing and reading, particularly nonfiction, can <br>cut across science and literacy learning. Uses of mathematical concepts and tools <br>are critical to scientific progress and understanding. Examples from history of <br>how scientists developed and argued about evidence for different scientific theo-<br>ries could support students’ understanding of how their own classroom scientific <br>practices play a role in validating knowledge. Similarly, there should be coherence <br>between science and social studies (as these terms are currently used in schools). <br>Applications of natural sciences and engineering to address important global <br>issues—such as climate change, the production and distribution of food, the <br>supply of water, and population growth—require knowledge from the social sci-<br>ences about social systems, cultures, and economics; societal decisions about the <br>advancement of science also require a knowledge of ethics. Basically, a coherent <br>set of science standards will not be sufficient to prepare citizens for the 21st cen-<br>tury unless there is also coherence across all subject areas of the K-12 curriculum.<br>Greater coherence may also enhance students’ motivation because their <br>development of competence is better supported.

In particu-<br>lar, performance expectations should provide students with multiple ways of <br>demonstrating competence in science.<br>As discussed in Chapter 11, the committee is convinced that, given appropri-<br>ate opportunities to learn and sufficient motivation, students from all backgrounds <br>can become competent in science. It is equally important that all students be pro-<br>vided with opportunities to demonstrate their competence in ways that do not <br>create unnecessary barriers. Standards should promote broadening participation in <br>science and engineering by focusing the education system on inclusive and mean-<br>ingful learning as well as on assessment experiences that maintain high academic <br>expectations for all students.<br>Previous standards for K-12 science education have been criticized for <br>obscuring the educational histories and circumstances of specific cultural groups <br>[18]. Diversity should be made visible in the new standards in ways that might, <br>for example, involve (a) presenting some performance tasks in the context of <br>historical scientific accomplishments, which include a broad variety of cultural <br>examples and do not focus exclusively on scientific discoveries made by scientists <br>in a limited set of countries; (b) addressing the educational issues encountered by <br>English language learners when defining performance expectations; (c) attending <br>to the funds of knowledge that specific communities possess with regard to spe-<br>cific core ideas and practices (e.g., knowledge of ecosystem dynamics in Native <br>American communities, knowledge of living organisms in agricultural communi-<br>ties) and with regard to performance expectations; (d) drawing on examples that <br>are not dominated by the interests of one gender, race, or culture; (e) ensuring that <br>students with particular learning disabilities are not excluded from appropriate <br>science learning; and (f) providing examples of performance tasks appropriate to <br>the special needs of such students.<br>The variety of issues raised by the above list illustrates the challenges of <br>providing learning opportunities and assessments that support all students in their <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br></span><span style="background-color: #FFD6A5;" title="Chunk 345 | Start: 768234 | End: 770171 | Tokens: 486">Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

In this final chapter, we <br>lay out aspects of a research and development (R&amp;D) agenda we think is <br>needed to provide evidence-based guidance for future revisions to K-12 science <br>education standards, which we expect will occur within the next 10-15 years. <br>Three factors that have served to stimulate the current attempt are likely to be <br>involved in the future effort: (1) changes in scientific knowledge and priorities; <br>(2) changes in the understanding of science learning and teaching across the K-12 <br>spectrum; and (3) changes in the understanding of how a given set of standards <br>is interpreted, taken up, and used by a variety of players to influence K-12 educa-<br>tional practice and policy. <br>Given these factors, the R&amp;D agenda proposed here is focused on the lat-<br>ter two areas, that is, on (1) enhancing understanding of how students learn <br>the core ideas and practices of science and how best to support that learning <br>through instruction and (2) developing a better understanding of how national- <br>and state-level standards are translated and implemented throughout the K-12 <br>science education system and how they eventually change classroom practice <br>and affect student learning. It also addresses three additional elements related to <br>understanding how standards are translated throughout the system: (1) research <br>on K-12 teachers’ knowledge of science and science practices and their teach-<br>ing practices; (2) research on effective professional development for support-<br>ing teachers’ understanding and uses of the standards; and (3) research on the <br>resulting curricula, curriculum materials and technology-based tools, instruc-<br>LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE<br>Research and Development to Inform K-12 Science <br>Education Standards<br>13<br><br></span><span style="background-color: #A0C4FF;" title="Chunk 349 | Start: 775588 | End: 777935 | Tokens: 495">A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Finally, rec-<br>ognizing the importance of equity and diversity, we have woven questions related <br>to these issues throughout both major sections of the chapter.<br>RESEARCH TO INFORM IMPLEMENTATION AND FUTURE REVISIONS OF THE <br>FRAMEWORK<br>In the following subsections, we lay out a plan for programs of research to exam-<br>ine key elements of science learning and teaching that should serve to influence <br>the future development of science education standards and implementation of <br>the framework. To do so, we draw heavily from the prior National Research <br>Council (NRC) report Learning and Instruction: A SERP Research Agenda, which <br>described a framework for research and development on learning and instruction <br>in the areas of mathematics, literacy, and science [1]. <br>The research plan we develop here is centrally concerned with issues of <br>teacher practice and curricular resources. The reason is that any set of standards is <br>about expectations for students’ knowledge and proficiency, which are necessarily <br>mediated by (1) the knowledge, wisdom, and practices of teachers; (2) the tools <br>provided to assist them in accomplishing their work; and (3) the contexts that <br>support the intellectual efforts of both teachers and students. <br>Core Questions Behind an R&amp;D Agenda on Learning and Teaching<br>The Learning and Instruction report laid out a set of core questions that focus <br>on the normal course of development and learning, as well as on diagnosing and <br>responding to students’ problems in mastering new concepts and acquiring new <br>knowledge and practices [1]. These questions, which provide a schema for exam-<br>ining teaching and learning, highlight the aspects of teachers’ knowledge that must <br>be supported through preservice experience and professional development. They <br></span><span style="background-color: #BDB2FF;" title="Chunk 350 | Start: 777935 | End: 780288 | Tokens: 506">are as follows: <br>1.	 What are the typical preconceptions that students hold about the prac-<br>tices, crosscutting concepts, and core ideas at the outset? <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Insights into typical student preconceptions of a topic <br>and the expected progression of student understanding require careful research <br>on the typical trajectories of learning. This research aims (a) to identify how the <br>nature and limits of children’s cognitive abilities change with age and instruction <br>and (b) to uncover common preconceptions that either support learning (e.g., <br>the ability to halve or double relatively easily in mathematics) or undermine it <br>(e.g., the belief that temperature measures the amount of heat present). Past find-<br>ings have suggested that students’ preconceptions are resilient, even after specific <br>instruction to the contrary. That resilience highlights the importance of a carefully <br>designed research program to inform and support teaching to achieve conceptual <br>change from naive preconceptions toward a more sophisticated scientific under-<br>standing of a topic. Although research of this sort is often the domain of cognitive <br>scientists and education researchers, their efforts can be enriched by the participa-<br></span><span style="background-color: #FFC6FF;" title="Chunk 351 | Start: 780288 | End: 782670 | Tokens: 503">tion of experienced teachers and by detailed study of exemplary practice.<br>Question 3. Educational experiences intended to move students along a learn-<br>ing path constitute the core of what we consider to be “instruction.” The work of <br>curriculum developers, teachers, and researchers helps to enable these experiences, <br>which may involve specific structured sequences of investigations or the use of <br>simulations, or they may take place across individual units or longer segments of <br>instruction. Regardless of the source, how each of these experiences contributes to <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>314<br>students’ development of more sophisticated understanding of crosscutting concepts, <br>disciplinary core ideas, and scientific and engineering practices—and therefore to <br>conceptual change—constitutes an important research agenda. Furthermore, the <br>effectiveness of the instructional approach used—and for what groups of students it <br>is effective—is a matter for empirical testing. <br>Question 4. General and discipline-specific norms and instructional practices <br>define the expectations for students’ and teachers’ interactions in the classroom. <br>“Classroom learning communities” and how they develop to support effective <br>learning are currently a subject of considerable research in science education. <br>Every such community is distinguished by norms for work and interactions, rang-<br>ing from when and how people <br>collaborate to how they speak with <br>one another. Some of those norms <br>are general, rooted in the under-<br>standing of schools in a demo-<br>cratic society; others are discipline <br>specific—that is, what it means <br>to do mathematics differs from <br>what it means to do chemistry or <br>history. In all cases, the relation-<br>ships between particular classroom <br>norms and learning outcomes of <br>interest for particular groups of <br>students—for example, distin-<br>guished by ethnicity or gender—are a matter for empirical investigation. Another <br>example is that the framework includes a number of discourse practices among <br>the science practices; because such discourses are relatively rare in science class-<br>rooms at present, research that focuses on how teachers and students develop the <br>related norms for them will be needed.<br></span><span style="background-color: #FFADAD;" title="Chunk 352 | Start: 782670 | End: 785111 | Tokens: 498">Question 5. Assessing students’ engagement in instructional activities <br>requires research on how young people of different backgrounds, cultures, races, <br>genders, abilities, and languages can enter and become full participants in the sci-<br>entific classroom community. Such research is especially needed if the framework’s <br>expectation that all students will have opportunities for accomplished scientific <br>and engineering learning is to succeed. How best to develop and sustain students’ <br>interest in science is an important part of research in this area.<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>315<br>Looking Toward the Future: Research and Development to Inform Standards<br>Question 6. Assessing an individual student’s understanding is the task of <br>research and development on methods and systems of assessment. This knowledge <br>base can quite naturally be developed and tested in the context of curriculum <br>R&amp;D, but it may also draw on more fundamental research—for example, on the <br>nature and measurement of text comprehension.<br>Key Areas of Research <br>Learning Progressions<br>In the context of the framework, an especially important line of inquiry should <br>involve learning progressions that embed the core ideas and practices spelled out <br>in this document. Such research may focus on a particular core idea and ask what <br>sequence of learning experiences, including engagement in practices, around that <br>idea best advance student understanding and address common misconceptions. <br>Research should also focus on whether other ideas and practices, if found across <br>multiple science topic learning progressions, ought to be specified as well. Such <br>work would be pertinent to Questions 1-6 above, as it would, of necessity, include <br>research on instructional approaches, sequences of curriculum, and students’ prog-<br>ress using those approaches and curricula. <br>There now exists a set of R&amp;D examples that include progressions for <br>some of the life, physical, and earth sciences core ideas described in the current <br>framework [2]. These examples also include student outcomes and instructional <br>activities that connect very directly to elements of the practices described in the <br>framework. Such work might be seen as constituting a set of downstream cases <br>in which further investment in implementation and testing might prove very valu-<br></span><span style="background-color: #FFD6A5;" title="Chunk 353 | Start: 785111 | End: 787626 | Tokens: 511">able, especially in terms of validating the hypothesized progressions and determin-<br>ing efficacy and effectiveness. Much of this work currently falls under the heading <br>of design-based research, and with further investment it might be ready to travel <br>farther via initial efficacy trials, which in turn move into large-scale replication, <br>perhaps with randomized trials. <br>It is worth noting that, because R&amp;D on learning progressions in science is <br>at an early stage, many aspects of the core ideas and their progressions over time <br>with instruction (as sketched out in the framework) remain unexplored territory. <br>The work needed would probably start with design experiments situated in class-<br>rooms that explore (a) how to specify the knowledge to be acquired by students at <br>particular grade bands and (b) what instructional approaches might best support <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>316<br>the proposed progressions. One interesting challenge in such work is that the vast <br>majority of what is known about the development of understanding across the full <br>K-12 grade span is based on cross-sectional designs; available longitudinal work is <br>of limited duration, given the sheer challenges of cost and practical management <br>associated with instructional research of long duration. Thus very little is known <br>about what can develop in later grades on the basis of successful implementation <br>of solid learning progressions for a concept in the earlier grades [3].<br>Work on learning progressions will also need to explore how literacy, lan-<br>guage skills, and mathematics intersect with learning in science across multiple <br>years of school. This research is important for understanding how the practices <br>develop over time and how learning experiences in other subjects might leverage <br>or be leveraged by learning in science.<br>Scientific and Engineering Practices<br>Another key aspect of the current framework is its emphasis on scientific and engi-<br>neering practices and their integration with the core concepts. Although research <br>has been done on how well students are able to engage in aspects of some of the <br>practices and how engagement in particular practices supports the development <br>of both specific ideas in science and understanding of the nature of science, this <br>work is fragmented. It does not yet provide insight into how students’ proficiency <br></span><span style="background-color: #FDFFB6;" title="Chunk 354 | Start: 787626 | End: 790114 | Tokens: 507">with these practices can develop over multiple years, nor how the full set of prac-<br>tices interacts with understanding of the core ideas and crosscutting concepts. For <br>example, people need to know a great deal more about the levels of sophistication <br>in these practices that are possible as students move from the early grade bands to <br>the later ones. In particular, the proficiencies that they can achieve and the types <br>of instructional materials and methods that can support that learning should be <br>explored. People also need to learn which scientific and engineering practices are <br>likely to pose significant challenges in terms of teacher knowledge with regard <br>both to content and pedagogy. <br>Development of Curricular and Instructional Materials<br>As discussed in Chapter 11, the framework and its resulting standards have a <br>number of implications for implementation, one of which involves the need for <br>curricular and instructional materials that embody all three dimensions: scientific <br>and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas. Some <br>existing materials will be highly compatible with aspects of the framework, others <br>will present implementation issues that bear further study, and there will also be <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>317<br>Looking Toward the Future: Research and Development to Inform Standards<br>a need to develop and test new materials and technological tools for learning that <br>work across grades and are aligned with the framework’s key ideas. In the case <br>of new materials, studies of students and teachers will be needed as they inter-<br>act with them over the short term (units) and long term (learning progressions). <br>Furthermore, new ways of using technology in learning and teaching science and <br>engineering (e.g., capturing data, analyzing and visualizing data, building models) <br>will continue to change what children can learn and be able to do at particular <br>grade bands [4] and provide new ways of assessing their learning. Thus, research <br>on learning must include research on how technology can be used to support and <br>enhance learning of specific topics. <br>R&amp;D will also be needed on the intersections of science as described in the <br>framework with literacy and mathematics and the implications for curriculum and <br>instruction. This should include how science curriculum can be designed to best <br></span><span style="background-color: #CAFFBF;" title="Chunk 355 | Start: 790114 | End: 792573 | Tokens: 506">articulate with curriculum in English/language arts and mathematics. <br>Assessment<br>Assessment of the outcomes of learning and instruction—what students know <br>and are able to do—merits special attention in R&amp;D on science education. The <br>high-quality evidence that derives from careful assessment allows practitioners, <br>researchers, and policy makers to explore critical questions about the student’s <br>knowledge or a program’s effectiveness and its possible need for revision <br>Designing Assessments. The first requirement for developing quality assessments <br>is that the concepts and skills that signal progress toward mastery of a subject be <br>understood and specified. In various areas of the curriculum, such as early read-<br>ing, early mathematics, and high school physics, substantial work has already <br>been done in this regard. In some cases, researchers have capitalized on such <br>knowledge to develop the elements of an assessment strategy, although that work <br>has generally concentrated on the development of materials for formative assess-<br>ment [5-7]. But, in general, people have yet to fully capitalize on research and the-<br>ory to develop valid assessment tools for other aspects of elementary and middle <br>school science. <br>To design and implement assessments that are fair—that is, valid across dif-<br>ferent groups of students—it is crucial that patterns of learning for different student <br>populations be studied. But much of the research on current theories of developing <br>knowledge has been conducted with restricted groups of students (mostly middle-<br>class whites). In many cases, it is not clear whether these theories apply equally <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>318<br>well to diverse populations of students, including those who have been poorly <br>served in the science and engineering education system—females, underrepresented <br>minorities, English language learners, and students with disabilities. <br>Although there are typical learning pathways, often there is not a single <br>pathway to competence. Furthermore, students will not necessarily respond in <br>similar ways to assessment probes designed to diagnose knowledge and under-<br>standing. These kinds of natural variations among individuals need to be better <br>understood through empirical study and incorporated into the cognitive models of <br></span><span style="background-color: #9BF6FF;" title="Chunk 356 | Start: 792573 | End: 794893 | Tokens: 506">learning that serve as a basis for assessment design.<br>Sophisticated models of learning do not by themselves produce high-quali-<br>ty assessment information. Also needed are methods and tools both for eliciting <br>appropriate and relevant data from students and for interpreting the data col-<br>lected about their performance. As described elsewhere [8], current measurement <br>methods enable a much broader range of inferences to be drawn about student <br>competence than many people realize. In particular, it is now possible to charac-<br>terize student achievement in terms of multiple aspects of proficiency rather than <br>in a single score; to chart students’ progress over time instead of simply measur-<br>ing performance at a particular point; to deal with multiple paths or alternative <br>methods of valued performance; to model, monitor, and improve judgments <br>based on informed evaluations; <br>and to evaluate performance not <br>only at the level of students but <br>also at the levels of groups, class-<br>es, schools, and states. <br>However, further research is <br>needed to (a) investigate the limits <br>and relative usefulness of existing <br>statistical models for capturing <br>critical aspects of learning; (b) <br>develop tools that make it easier <br>for those who have professional <br>interest but do not have the full <br>range of psychometric expertise to <br>apply new measurement approaches; <br>and (c) develop cost-effective tools that allow education professionals, including <br>teachers and policy makers, to use the results of these approaches. <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Researchers should explore (a) how new forms of assessment can be made <br>both accessible to teachers and practical for use in classrooms; (b) how assessments <br>can be made efficient for use in large-scale testing contexts; (c) how assessments <br>can be designed so that all students have equal opportunities to demonstrate their <br>competencies; (d) how information from classroom-level assessments and large-scale <br>assessments can be combined reliably for use in addressing educational problems; <br></span><span style="background-color: #A0C4FF;" title="Chunk 357 | Start: 794893 | End: 797292 | Tokens: 509">and (e) how various new forms of assessment affect student learning, teacher prac-<br>tice, and educational decision making [9]. <br>It is particularly important that such work be done in close collaboration <br>with practicing teachers who have diverse backgrounds and varying levels of <br>teaching experience. Also to be studied are ways in which school structures (e.g., <br>class time, class size, mechanisms for teachers to work together) affect the feasibil-<br>ity of new assessment types and their effectiveness.<br>Supporting Teachers’ Learning<br>The research base on science teacher learning has been growing [10], often cen-<br>tered on Shulman’s [11] framework of teacher knowledge [12]. For example, it is <br>now known that preservice elementary school teachers have some of the same pre-<br>conceptions of scientific concepts as their students [13] and that even experienced <br>teachers have difficulty acquiring the kinds of science knowledge and teaching <br>practices that support students’ learning [14]. <br>Preservice secondary school science teachers sometimes encounter problems <br>with the conceptual content [15, 16] and in implementing aspects of scientific <br>discourses and practices [17]. Similarly, these teachers often have an incomplete <br>understanding of the nature of scientific evidence [18], and their knowledge about <br>students’ conceptions may be limited [19]. <br>Thus continued research is needed to better understand the possible longi-<br>tudinal trajectories that K-12 teachers may take in becoming knowledgeable and <br>accomplished science teachers. <br>As noted in Learning and Instruction [1], the questions that frame student <br>learning apply just as aptly to teacher learning. Teachers should understand stu-<br>dents’ naive ideas and learning processes well enough to assess and guide them, <br>and they should understand the crosscutting concepts, disciplinary core ideas, and <br>scientific and engineering practices well enough to select appropriate instructional <br>materials and strategies and apply them effectively. Teachers should use assess-<br>ments to plan for, revise, and adapt instruction; to evaluate teaching and learning; <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Questions for inquiry include: <br>Under what conditions and in what contexts can teachers best learn particular sci-<br>entific and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas <br>during their teacher preparation and with ongoing professional development? <br>What knowledge and methods are most important for teachers to acquire at the <br>beginning of their careers? What knowledge and methods are better acquired once <br>they enter the profession? What organizational, material, and human resources are <br>necessary to support and sustain teacher learning over time? <br>UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF THE FRAMEWORK AND RELATED-STANDARDS<br>The R&amp;D agenda for understanding the influence of standards is based heavily <br>on the NRC report Investigating the Influence of Standards: A Framework for <br>Research in Mathematics, Science, and Technology Education [20] and on a chap-<br>ter in The Impact of State and National Standards on K-12 Science Teaching [21], <br>which draws on the NRC report. Although much has changed since these reports <br>were released, including substantial shifts in state and federal education policies, <br>the analysis of the education systems and how standards may influence them is a <br>valuable starting point. <br>In the subsections that follow, we focus on four components through which <br>the framework and its resulting standards might ultimately influence student <br>learning. These parallel components are also discussed in Chapter 10, which <br>addresses implementation. The purpose of the research on implementation is both <br>to determine whether the framework and standards are being implemented and, <br>more importantly, to identify barriers to implementation and ways to overcome <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFC6FF;" title="Chunk 359 | Start: 799763 | End: 802213 | Tokens: 502">these barriers. <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>321<br>Looking Toward the Future: Research and Development to Inform Standards<br>Curriculum and Instructional Materials<br>The framework intentionally does not prescribe a specific curriculum, but it does <br>imply criteria for designing a curriculum and selecting instructional materials. If <br>the framework were to influence what is taught to students, then curriculum pol-<br>icy, the design and development of instructional materials, including technology-<br>based materials and tools, and the processes and criteria by which such materials <br>were developed, selected, and implemented in classrooms would reflect the frame-<br>work’s practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas. <br>Enrollment and achievement patterns in schools would reveal whether the <br>vision expressed by the framework applied to all students. For example, if the <br>framework were permeating the system, opportunities for taking challenging <br>science courses would be open to every student, and resources needed to imple-<br>ment a robust standards-based curriculum would be allocated in equitable ways. <br>Resources designed to accommodate diverse learners, including those learning <br>English as a second language, would support the focus of the standards on all <br>students having access to opportunities to learn important science and engineering <br>concepts and practices.<br>Key questions related to tracing the influence of the framework and stan-<br>dards on the curriculum include<br> <br>• <br>What curriculum development efforts have been undertaken to provide <br>materials that are well aligned to the framework and new standards? Who <br>was engaged in these efforts?

States, districts, and postsecondary institutions, including lateral entry <br>programs, would create mechanisms that enable prospective teachers to gain the <br>knowledge and practices needed to help students meet the expectations outlined in <br>the framework. Teacher preparation programs would prepare prospective teachers <br>to teach in diverse classrooms, and the distribution across schools of teachers with <br>the knowledge and practices for implementing effective science and engineering <br>education would be such that all learners would have access to high-quality learn-<br>ing opportunities. <br>Policies and fiscal investments at the local, state, and federal levels would <br>focus on recertification criteria, professional development opportunities, and <br>system-wide support strategies aligned with the framework. States and localities <br>would provide a rich framework-based infrastructure to support science and engi-<br>neering teaching. Teachers would be motivated to enhance their understanding of <br>core concepts and practices described in the framework, and recertification criteria <br>and teacher evaluations would focus on evidence that verified teachers’ knowl-<br>edge, understanding, and practices were consistent with the framework.<br>Key questions related to tracing the influence of the framework and stan-<br>dards on teacher and administrator development include<br> <br>• <br>How have teacher educators used the framework and standards to improve <br>their science teacher preparation programs?

There is a <br>need for ongoing research on science teaching and learning, and particularly on <br>learning progressions for the core ideas detailed here. In addition there is need <br>for research on the impacts and implementation of the next generation of stan-<br>dards, and of this framework, to identify both barriers and effective strategies. <br>Such research needs to consider three levels—system, school, and classroom—in <br>order to effectively inform future decisions about standards. Research on school-<br>level factors—such as professional development targeted at administrators’ and <br>teachers’ knowledge and practices, the design and testing of learning progressions <br>across the framework’s three dimensions—would support choices about where to <br>place particular scientific and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts, and dis-<br>ciplinary core ideas in future K-12 science standards. <br>Perhaps most important, research is needed on classroom-level contexts, <br>materials, and discourses that engage and support a wider range of students in <br>high-quality teaching and learning experiences with the concepts, ideas, and prac-<br>tices. Action on this wide-ranging multilevel agenda would make it possible to <br>advance the framework’s vision and continue to improve access for all.<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

For this reason, we secured permission from the National <br>Research Council (NRC) to release a draft version of the framework for public <br>comment. The draft underwent an expedited NRC review in early July 2010 and <br>was posted online on July 12 for a 3-week period. <br>This draft did not include all of the chapters intended for the final volume, <br>although it did thoroughly address all three dimensions of the framework: cross-<br>cutting concepts, disciplinary core ideas, and scientific and engineering practices. <br>Individuals could submit comments through an online survey. In addition, NRC <br>staff contacted over 40 organizations in science, engineering, and education to <br>notify them of the public comment period; they were asked to hold focus groups <br>for gathering feedback from their members or to notify members of the oppor-<br>tunity to comment online. Notably, the NRC worked closely with the National <br>Science Teachers Association, the American Association for the Advancement of <br>Science, Achieve, Inc., and the Council of State Science Supervisors to facilitate the <br>public input process. Finally, the committee asked a number of disciplinary experts <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFADAD;" title="Chunk 368 | Start: 819252 | End: 821562 | Tokens: 507">to provide detailed feedback on the draft from their own particular perspectives.<br>During the 3-week public comment period, the committee received exten-<br>sive input from both individuals and groups. Overall, more than 2,000 people <br>responded to the online survey. Over 30 focus groups were held around the coun-<br>try by 24 organizations, with a total of over 400 participants.

Committee <br>members then evaluated these summaries and potential revisions, and they had the <br>opportunity to examine the public feedback in detail. After discussions at its fifth <br>and sixth meetings, the committee made substantial revisions to the framework <br>based on the feedback. <br>We summarize this feedback below and describe the revisions that were <br>made in response. In cases in which the committee chose not to revise or to make <br>only a limited revision, we explain why this choice was made. We organize the <br>discussion into two sections: overarching issues, which pertain to the draft frame-<br>work as a whole, and issues relating specifically to any of the framework’s three <br>dimensions or its learning progressions.<br>OVERARCHING ISSUES<br>In general, the feedback about the draft framework indicated support for the over-<br>all approach. In the online surveys, many individuals commented that they were <br>impressed with the document and thought it provided a good next step toward <br>refining standards for K-12 science education. At the same time, there were many <br>critiques and suggestions for how to improve it.

Several focus groups suggested that a coherent vision <br>across the document was lacking. Some individuals thought Chapter 1 provided <br>a good summary of key principles, and others thought the vision was too diffuse. <br>Across all of the modes of response and across all kinds of individuals, people <br>commented that the promise of the first chapter was not consistently delivered in <br>the rest of the document. Some commenters said explicitly that the framework had <br>gone too far toward standards. Others said that the document would be difficult <br>for teachers to use. <br>Several comments from individuals and summaries from focus groups called <br>for more discussion of the goals of science education and a stronger argument <br>in the first chapter for why science education is important. There was confu-<br>sion about whether the document was outlining goals for all students or only for <br>college-bound students. <br>Commenters were divided on the tone of the document and its quality of <br>writing. Some thought it was well written; others thought it needed to be entirely <br>rewritten in more accessible language. <br>Response<br>The committee made several revisions aimed at giving the framework greater <br>focus, clarifying its goals and audience(s), and eliminating differences in tone and <br></span><span style="background-color: #FDFFB6;" title="Chunk 370 | Start: 823849 | End: 826352 | Tokens: 506">writing style. We reframed the introductory chapter, incorporated an argument for <br>the importance of science education, provided a concise discussion of the goals  <br>for science education for all students, and added an explicit vision statement. Also, <br>we shifted material that described the theoretical and empirically based assump-<br>tions guiding the framework to a second chapter. <br>To enable readers to identify the major tasks for standards developers in <br>translating the framework into standards, we added Chapter 12: Guidance for <br>Standards Developers. In that chapter, the committee presents a set of 13 recom-<br>mendations that lay out the steps that standards developers should take and the <br>considerations they need to keep in mind as they translate the framework into <br>standards. Finally, the report was edited extensively to achieve a more uniform <br>style and voice for improved readability.<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>334<br>Suggestions of Fields or Topics to Be Included<br>Several stakeholder groups voiced strong concerns that content relevant to their <br>disciplines was either underrepresented or left out entirely. The strongest concerns <br>were voiced by organizations and individuals affiliated with the behavioral and <br>social sciences, computer sciences, and ocean sciences. Each of these communities <br>mounted some kind of formal response, including letters from professional societ-<br>ies and campaigns to encourage their membership to respond to the online survey. <br>There also was mention of health, but this involved a less organized response. <br>Behavioral and Social Sciences. The behavioral and social sciences com-<br>munity made a very strong request for inclusion in the framework. Community <br>members wanted to see these fields acknowledged throughout the document <br>as legitimate elements of the overall scientific enterprise. They also wanted to <br>see a separate set of core ideas developed for the behavioral and social sciences <br>and included in the framework. They pointed out that courses related to the <br>behavioral and social sciences are already included at the secondary level (e.g., <br>Advanced Placement psychology). Acknowledging that developing a separate set <br>of core ideas would take time, they asked that the framework’s project time line <br>be extended accordingly. They also noted many places where the social sciences <br></span><span style="background-color: #CAFFBF;" title="Chunk 371 | Start: 826352 | End: 828733 | Tokens: 509">could inform issues that were raised, particularly in discussions related to science, <br>technology, and society.<br>Computer Science. We received a similar request for inclusion from the com-<br>puter science community. Some of its members noted that computing and com-<br>putational thinking are now an integral part of science and therefore constitute <br>essential knowledge and practices for students who might pursue careers in science <br>or engineering. They pointed out that computer science and programming courses <br>are already part of the K-12 curriculum, although they are not usually identified <br>as part of the science curriculum. <br>Ocean Science. This community pointed to the framework’s lack of specific <br>attention to the ocean, it suggested a greater focus on earth systems than was cap-<br>tured in the draft, and it offered very concrete and detailed suggestions for revi-<br>sions. The community developed some standard wording for members to use in <br>filling out the survey. For example, there was an argument for greater inclusion of <br>ocean sciences in the earth and space sciences section. <br>Nature of Science. Many of those who provided comments thought that the <br>“nature of science” needed to be made an explicit topic or idea. They noted that it <br>would not emerge simply through engaging with practices.<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>Appendix A<br>335<br>Response<br>Behavioral and Social Sciences. The committee considers the behavioral and <br>social sciences to be part of science, but for a number of reasons we think it inap-<br>propriate at this time to include them as a separate disciplinary area with its own <br>set of core ideas. The primary reason is that these subjects are not currently part <br>of what is considered the K-12 science curriculum. To include them here would <br>speak to a major reorganization of K-12 schooling, which would go far beyond <br>the committee’s charge and, indeed, the professional expertise of the committee. <br>In grades K-8, topics related to the behavioral and social sciences are typically <br>covered in social studies, although they are not necessarily taught from a scien-<br>tific perspective. At the secondary level, there are courses that do teach behavioral <br>and social sciences topics from a scientific perspective—for example, Advanced <br></span><span style="background-color: #9BF6FF;" title="Chunk 372 | Start: 828733 | End: 831174 | Tokens: 504">Placement psychology. However, the framework as currently structured does not <br>prevent these courses from being taught. In fact, the committee considers them <br>appropriate science courses for extending and enriching the foundational science <br>education described in the framework. <br>The secondary reason is that the committee has a responsibility to meet its <br>charge and to maintain as closely as possible the intended time line of its work <br>in order to inform the science standards development efforts of Achieve, Inc. <br>Undertaking the task of identifying and articulating the core ideas in the behav-<br>ioral and social sciences would be impossible within the available time and budget <br>constraints. In the committee’s judgment, this is a task for another group. <br>Although the committee did not think it was appropriate to include the <br>behavioral and social sciences as a separate discipline, we did make efforts to dis-<br>cuss them explicitly throughout the document and particularly to identify places <br>where they intersect with the framework’s three dimensions. More specifically, the <br>following changes were made in response to this input: <br>• <br>In the Introduction, we acknowledge that the behavioral and social sci-<br>ences are part of science and that they are not broadly represented in this <br>framework. <br>• <br>We revised language throughout the report to note the role of behavioral <br>and social sciences expertise for addressing such issues as the connections <br>among science, technology, and society. <br>• <br>We included some behavioral and social sciences examples in the descrip-<br>tions of science and in the chapters on crosscutting concepts and scientific <br>and engineering practices. <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>336<br>• <br>We added more emphasis on behavior and psychology, especially cognitive <br>science, in the life sciences chapter, including a component idea on informa-<br>tion processing under LS1 and a component idea on social interactions and <br>group behavior under LS2.<br>Computer Science. In considering whether and how to include topics related to <br>computer science, the committee noted that such concepts are more typically <br>included under mathematics; we acknowledge, however, that the mathematics <br>common core does not include such topics as algorithms or algorithmic approach-<br></span><span style="background-color: #A0C4FF;" title="Chunk 373 | Start: 831174 | End: 833597 | Tokens: 504">es to computation and includes very little about the use of computational tools. <br>Although the committee determined that it was not appropriate to include <br>computer science in the framework as a separate discipline with its own set of <br>core ideas, in the revisions of the draft we made an effort to stress the impor-<br>tance both of computational thinking and of the use of computers as scientific <br>tools, particularly in Chapter 3: Scientific and Engineering Practices. One of the <br>eight major practices is labeled “Using Mathematics, Information and Computer <br>Technology, and Computational Thinking,” and the chapter stresses the impor-<br>tance of the application of these skills throughout science learning. The chapter <br>also includes more emphasis on computers as tools for modeling, data collection <br>and recording, and data analysis. <br>Although the framework does not include material usually covered by <br>courses under the title “computer science,” we stress that this choice in no way <br>diminishes the importance either of general computer literacy for all students or of <br>options for advanced computer science courses at the high school level.<br>Ocean Science. The earth and space sciences core ideas and grade band endpoints <br>were revised to include more attention to the ocean whenever possible and to shift <br>to more of a focus on earth systems. <br>Nature of Science. The committee added a section to the end of Chapter 4 to <br>emphasize the need to reflect on scientific and engineering practices as a means to <br>deepen students’ understanding of the nature of science.<br>Inclusion of Engineering and Technology<br>The inclusion of engineering and technology and their own set of core ideas gener-<br>ated a substantial amount of feedback. Many indicated that they were pleased to <br>see engineering and technology given an explicit place in K-12 science education. <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>Appendix A<br>337<br>However, there were numerous concerns, including the amount of space devoted <br>to engineering and technology, the kinds of core ideas included, and the capacity <br>of the K-12 science education system to get these areas right. Some individuals <br>commented that including engineering and technology could present a problem: <br>given that a goal of the framework is to cut the amount of material to be covered <br></span><span style="background-color: #BDB2FF;" title="Chunk 374 | Start: 833597 | End: 836075 | Tokens: 506">in K-12 science, it would be ironic if such inclusion expanded the amount of mate-<br>rial considerably. <br>One key issue that appeared frequently in the comments was whether engi-<br>neering and technology were well defined in the framework. This suggested the <br>need to be more explicit about how engineering and technology are related to <br>each other and to the natural sciences. Thoughtful advice from the experts we <br>consulted was that some of the engineering and technology ideas incorporated ele-<br>ments that would be more appropriately placed in practices. <br>A letter to the committee from the International Technology and Engineering <br>Educators Association raised a number of issues related to including engineer-<br>ing and technology in the science framework. The association argued that science <br>teachers might not have sufficient background to teach the new material and, <br>moreover, that there is currently no agreement in the field about what the core <br>ideas in engineering and technology should be. The letter also pointed out that a <br>corps of technology teachers at the secondary level already exists.<br>A related issue among respondents was treatment of the applications of sci-<br>ence (such as medicine, public health, and agriculture) and their links to engineer-<br>ing and technology. Some individuals suggested that this topic needed more atten-<br>tion in the draft framework. Experts we asked to review the draft also pointed out <br>that discussion of applications of science was mostly absent there.<br>Response<br>The committee deliberated extensively on the best way to respond to these con-<br>cerns and chose to make significant revisions. We trimmed the material included <br>under engineering and technology and focused on design as one of the major ele-<br>ments of engineering. We did this because design is the one core idea of engineer-<br>ing around which there appears to be consensus [2]. There also is evidence that <br>engaging in design activities can enhance students’ understanding of science [3]. <br>Elements of design are now represented in Chapter 3: Scientific <br>and Engineering Practices and also under the first core idea in Chapter 8: <br>Engineering, Technology, and Applications of Science. The second core idea, <br>which stresses the connections among engineering, technology, science, and <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Definitions of engineering, <br>technology, and applications of science and of the relationships among them are <br>clearly stated. These definitions then inform how engineering and technology are <br>treated throughout the framework.<br>Too Much Material<br>Many individuals and organizations indicated that the draft framework still <br>contained too much material, and some thought that the committee had not suc-<br>ceeded in making any reduction compared with previous documents. There were <br>particular concerns not only about the amount of the material but also about its <br>difficulty for the earlier grades. People also expressed trepidation that the learning <br>progressions in the draft contained too many discrete and disconnected notions <br>and that some were not central to the core idea being developed. <br>Response<br>The committee was particularly concerned with this feedback and in response <br>made significant revisions to the core ideas and progressions. We revised the struc-<br>ture and content of the core ideas in all of the disciplines and replaced detailed <br>progressions with grade band endpoints for grades 2, 5, 8, and 12. When neces-<br>sary we consulted experts in teaching and learning science to supplement the <br>committee’s expertise. For example, six experts on learning science in grades K-5 <br>provided detailed input regarding what ideas were appropriate for those levels and <br>in which grade. As a result, some core ideas or component ideas begin their pro-<br>gression only at the 3-5 grade band to allow necessary prior knowledge of other <br>core ideas to be established. <br>Overall, the committee thinks that the framework’s content is now con-<br>tained in a more suitable structure—one that provides guidance to standards <br>developers rather than extremely detailed sets of discrete content statements.<br>How to Integrate the Three Dimensions<br>There were many concerns that too little guidance was given about how to inte-<br>grate the crosscutting concepts, disciplinary core ideas, and scientific and engineer-<br>ing practices. In particular it was deemed that the learning progressions in the <br>draft framework did not integrate the three dimensions at all, focusing solely on <br>the progression for the core ideas. <br>The presentation of the crosscutting concepts and the practices in sepa-<br>rate chapters led some to ask whether there would be separate standards for the <br></span><span style="background-color: #FFADAD;" title="Chunk 376 | Start: 838482 | End: 840902 | Tokens: 499"><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>Appendix A<br>339<br>crosscutting concepts and for the practices. Some pointed out that, without guid-<br>ance about integration, the crosscutting concepts might be omitted entirely or be <br>taught as a set of separate ideas. <br>Response<br>The committee was charged with identifying the disciplinary core ideas and prac-<br>tices for K-12 science education and with providing examples of the integration of <br>these ideas and practices. One of the major tasks of the standards developers will <br>be to determine ways to integrate the dimensions at the level of standards and per-<br>formance expectations; we anticipate that full integration of the dimensions will <br>occur at the level of curriculum and instruction.<br>In attending to the framework itself, we expanded Chapter 9: Integrating <br>the Three Dimensions, which in the draft included only examples of perfor-<br>mance expectations; for example, we added an example of how the dimensions <br>might be brought together in curriculum and instruction. We also created a <br>chapter on implementation issues (Chapter 10) that spelled out the need for cur-<br>ricula and instruction that integrate the three dimensions. Finally, in Chapter 12: <br>Guidance for Standards Developers, we explicitly recommended that standards <br>should incorporate the three dimensions in both their content statements and <br>performance expectations. <br>Strengthening Connections to Other Subjects<br>Many people wanted to see more connections made to mathematics and lit-<br>eracy, some asked for explicit connections to the Common Core Standards, and <br>some wanted to see more indications of the links between the core ideas and <br>other disciplines. <br>Response<br>We added explicit reference to other subject areas in multiple places. In the <br>chapter on scientific and engineering practices, we included two practices that <br>specifically link to mathematics and literacy: “Using Mathematics, Information <br>and Computer Technology, and Computational Thinking” and “Obtaining, <br>Communicating, and Presenting Information.” In discussions of these practices, <br>we called out the need to parallel the Common Core Standards. We also included <br>a recommendation for standards developers that the science standards be consis-<br>tent with the mathematics and English/language arts Common Core Standards.

Many also com-<br>mented on a lack of clear statements about diversity and equity. <br>Response<br>In the introductory chapter, we clarified the vision for the framework and its <br>emphasis on science for all students. We added Chapter 11: Equity and Diversity <br>in Science and Engineering Education. This chapter had already been planned, but <br>it was not ready in time for the draft released in July 2010.<br>Implementation: Curriculum, Instruction, Teacher Development, and Assessment<br>Many educators raised concerns about the challenges to implementing the frame-<br>work—especially the demands it would place on curriculum developers, providers <br>of professional development, and others. In some cases, commenters suggested <br>that it would be useful to include the kinds of standards related to curriculum, <br>instruction, teacher development, and assessment that were presented in the <br>National Science Education Standards [1]. <br>Response<br>The committee already recognized the challenges that the framework will place on <br>K-12 science education. But although we had planned a chapter related to imple-<br>mentation, it was not available for the 2010 draft release. We have since written <br>this chapter, and it is included in the present document as Chapter 10.<br>ISSUES RELATED TO EACH DIMENSION<br>Chapter 3: Scientific and Engineering Practices<br>Overall, the majority of those who commented were pleased to see discussion <br>of scientific and engineering practices. Some specifically mentioned that it was a <br>positive step to discuss particular practices instead of referring broadly to inquiry. <br>There were varying reactions to the chapter itself. Some felt that there was too <br>much introductory material about the work of scientists and engineers generally <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>Appendix A<br>341<br>and that this discussion could be cut. Others thought that too many discrete prac-<br></span><span style="background-color: #FDFFB6;" title="Chunk 378 | Start: 843398 | End: 845767 | Tokens: 500">tices with no uniform “grain size” were specified. Some had difficulty understand-<br>ing how the tables in the chapter that described progressions were to be used in <br>conjunction with the tables outlining the learning progressions for the disciplinary <br>core ideas. Feedback from the individual experts indicated that in several cases the <br>detailed progressions for the practices did not have supporting empirical evidence.<br>Response<br>We revised the introductory material in the chapter to make it more focused. We <br>collapsed the practices into a shorter top-level list. We discussed developmental <br>trajectories for each practice but cut the tables and the “levels” of practice that <br>they had introduced. We refined the parallel treatment of scientific and engineer-<br>ing practices and clarified how the goals of work in the two areas differ.<br>Chapter 4: Crosscutting Concepts<br>Most of those who provided comments liked the framework’s inclusion of cross-<br>cutting concepts. There were some suggestions of particular concepts to cut <br>and of others to add. Many suggested that the section titled “Topics in Science, <br>Engineering, Technology, and Society” did not fit in this dimension and should be <br>integrated elsewhere.<br>Response<br>We chose not to delete or add to the crosscutting concepts. We did remove <br>“Topics in Science, Engineering, Technology, and Society” from this chapter and <br>placed the important elements of that material elsewhere (in practices; in the engi-<br>neering, technology, and applications of science chapter; and in the chapter on <br>implementation under the discussion of curriculum). <br>Chapters 5-8: Disciplinary Core Ideas<br>Many commenters provided detailed feedback on the core ideas and component <br>ideas in each discipline. Their comments ranged from whether the inclusion of a <br>core or component idea was appropriate, to suggestions for additions, to word-<br>level editorial changes. Expert feedback from individuals and focus groups was <br>particularly helpful in guiding the revisions of these four chapters. <br>Overall, readers tended to assume that each core idea would be given equal <br>time in curriculum and instruction, leading to the impression, for example, that <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Although <br>we have reduced the number of core ideas in Chapter 8: Engineering, Technology, <br>and Applications of Science, we also noted that different core ideas will take dif-<br>ferent amounts of instructional time, both within and across grade levels; thus, the <br>above-cited accounting was not a correct interpretation of the document. We have <br>made appropriate clarifications in the introductory chapter and in the guidance <br>for standards developers.<br>Physical Sciences. Physicists expressed concern that the content in physics <br>was not articulated clearly, and chemists had a similar concern about the chem-<br>istry ideas. These responses suggested confusion about whether the framework <br>is intended to define a full chemistry and physics course at the high school level. <br>The committee’s actual intent is for the framework to outline a foundational <br>set of core ideas and for individual courses in physics or chemistry to deepen or <br>extend the study of these ideas. Input from a group convened by the American <br>Association of Physics Teachers, the American Physical Society, the American <br>Institute of Physics, and the American Chemical Society was particularly useful. <br>There were some specific critiques of the core ideas on waves and communi-<br>cation technology, with some individuals suggesting that they were inappropriate <br>to include in the physical sciences. <br>Life Sciences. Aside from a small subset of responders who wanted to <br>eliminate evolution, overall the response to the life sciences core ideas was posi-<br>tive. Critique focused on (a) elements perceived as missing or underemphasized, <br>particularly regarding psychology and behavior, and (b) elements perceived as <br>misplaced in terms of grade-level appropriateness. Our disciplinary experts, who <br>gave thoughtful input based on research on learning, suggested greater stress on <br>the physical, chemical, and molecular bases of biological processes, at least in the <br>higher grades. <br>Earth and Space Sciences. Several responders indicated that there were too <br>many component ideas in this domain, and they offered concrete suggestions for <br>reducing or streamlining the number of topics. Some individuals thought that the <br>organization of the core and component ideas in the earth and space sciences was <br>less conceptually coherent than in the other disciplines. They expressed concern <br></span><span style="background-color: #9BF6FF;" title="Chunk 380 | Start: 848187 | End: 850541 | Tokens: 504">that the ideas were more like a table of contents for a textbook than a coherent <br>learning progression. Some noted that the level of detail was uneven, both within <br>the earth and space sciences chapter and in comparison to the other science disci-<br>plines. Responders offered specific examples of ideas in the learning progressions <br>that seemed developmentally inappropriate—that would require understanding of <br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>Appendix A<br>343<br>concepts from other disciplines or that were actually introduced in later grades. <br>A number of reviewers suggested placing more emphasis on an “earth systems” <br>approach; this suggestion was particularly emphasized by the ocean science <br>community. <br>Engineering and Technology. The feedback related to these core ideas, <br>together with the committee’s response, is summarized in the previous section <br>(Chapter 3: Scientific and Engineering Practices).<br>Response<br>The committee undertook significant revisions of the core and component ideas <br>for all of the disciplines. For the physical sciences and the earth and space sci-<br>ences, the revisions included reorganization and relabeling of the core and com-<br>ponent ideas. <br>Learning Progressions<br>Many concerns were expressed about the draft learning progressions—the sections <br>in Chapters 5-8 now labeled “Grade Band Endpoints.” Several people, including <br>some of the individual experts we asked to comment, objected to the term “learn-<br>ing progressions” for these sequences. They offered a number of reasons for why <br>this term should not be used and made strong cases for changing it. <br>There was also concern about the level of detail included in the progres-<br>sions; some felt that they went too far toward becoming standards. There was <br>concern that the progressions were presented as many discrete bits of knowledge, <br>which seemed to promote memorization of facts. Some thought that, for certain <br>component ideas, the connections from grade band to grade band were unclear. <br>And there was concern that the progressions were not clearly based on research; a <br>couple of the experts pointed out places for which research suggests realignment <br>of the content. <br>A number of criticisms stated that the progressions were not always grade <br></span><span style="background-color: #A0C4FF;" title="Chunk 381 | Start: 850541 | End: 852952 | Tokens: 501">appropriate; some pointed out that material included in the K-5 bands in particu-<br>lar was often too difficult. Others thought that the progressions underestimated <br>what younger students can do. There was general concern that the expectations <br>for the 3-5 and 6-8 grade bands were quite high, given the number of very impor-<br>tant, but challenging, ideas that were covered. Finally, there was concern that the <br>progressions focused on the disciplinary core ideas and did not attempt to inte-<br>grate the crosscutting concepts and scientific and engineering practices in any way.<br><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.<br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education<br>344<br>Response<br>The committee was especially attentive to the feedback on the learning progres-<br>sions. The detailed progressions were changed to grade band endpoints, with the <br>number of details significantly reduced. Meanwhile, the introductory discussion <br>of each core idea was expanded into a single coherent statement that reflected the <br>idea’s overall knowledge content. <br>To address the concerns about grade-level appropriateness, the committee <br>solicited additional comments from six experts in science learning in grades K-5. <br>Based on this feedback and review of the document by committee members with <br>expertise in elementary school science, some core ideas or component ideas were <br>excluded at the K-2 level, with development of these ideas beginning instead in the <br>3-5 grade band. <br>ORGANIZATIONS THAT CONVENED DISCUSSION/FOCUS GROUPS <br>Achieve, Inc.<br>American Association of Physics Teachers, American Physical Society,  <br>	<br>American Institute of Physics<br>American Astronomical Society Astronomy Education Board<br>American Chemical Society<br>American Geological Institute<br>American Geophysical Union<br>American Society of Plant Biologists<br>Association for Computing Machinery<br>Association for Science Teacher Education<br>Biotechnology Institute<br>Climate Literacy Network<br>Computer Science Teachers Association<br>Council of Elementary Science International<br>Council of State Science Supervisors (45 state representatives in 8 groups)<br>Einstein Fellows<br>Hands-On Science Partnership<br>International Technology and Engineering Education Association<br>Massachusetts Department of Education<br>Minnesota Department of Education<br>NASA Science Education and Public Outreach<br></span><span style="background-color: #BDB2FF;" title="Chunk 382 | Start: 852952 | End: 855484 | Tokens: 509"><br>A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas<br>Copyright National Academy of Sciences.
