The framework is designed to directly address and overcome \nthese weaknesses.\n\nA Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas\nCopyright National Academy of Sciences.

From this work, the \ncommittee concludes that K-12 science and engineering education should focus on \na limited number of disciplinary core ideas and crosscutting concepts, be designed \nso that students continually build on and revise their knowledge and abilities over \nmultiple years, and support the integration of such knowledge and abilities with the \npractices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design. \nThe committee recommends that science education in grades K-12 be built \naround three major dimensions (see Box S-1 for details of each dimension). These \ndimensions are\n\u2022\t\nScientific and engineering practices\n\u2022\t\nCrosscutting concepts that unify the study of science and engineering \nthrough their common application across fields\n\u2022\t\nCore ideas in four disciplinary areas: physical sciences; life sciences; earth \nand space sciences; and engineering, technology, and applications of science \nTo support students\u2019 meaningful learning in science and engineering, all \nthree dimensions need to be integrated into standards, curriculum, instruction, and \nassessment. Engineering and technology are featured alongside the natural sciences \n(physical sciences, life sciences, and earth and space sciences) for two critical rea-\nsons: (1) to reflect the importance of understanding the human-built world and (2) \nto recognize the value of better integrating the teaching and learning of science, \nengineering, and technology. \nThe broad set of expectations for students articulated in the framework is \n",

This interplay of sci-\nence and engineering makes it appropriate to \nplace engineering and technology as part of \nthe science framework at the K-12 level. In \nthis way, students can better see how science and engineering pertain to real-world \nproblems and explore opportunities to apply their scientific knowledge to engi-\nneering design problems once this linkage is made. \nFinally, our effort to identify a small number of core ideas may disappoint \nsome scientists and educators who find little or nothing of their favorite science \ntopics included in the framework.

Equity \nas an expression of socially enlightened self-interest is reflected in calls to invest in the science and engineering \neducation of underrepresented groups simply because American labor needs can no longer be met by recruiting \namong the traditional populations. Equity as an expression of social justice is manifested in calls to remedy the \ninjustices visited on entire groups of American society that in the past have been underserved by their schools \nand have thereby suffered severely limited prospects of high-prestige careers in science and engineering.

In \naddition, the issue of connecting to students\u2019 interests and experiences is particu-\nlarly important for broadening participation in science.

        "Similarly, engineering involves both knowledge and a set of practices. \nThe major goal of engineering is to solve problems that arise from a specific \nhuman need or desire. To do this, engineers rely on their knowledge of science \nand mathematics as well as their understanding of the engineering design pro-\ncess. Defining and solving the problem, that is, specifying what is needed and \ndesigning a solution for it, are the parts of engineering on which we focus in this \nframework, both because they provide students a place to practice the appli-\ncation of their understanding of science and because the design process is an \nimportant way for K-12 students to develop an understanding of engineering as \n\u275a Science is not just a body of knowledge that reflects current \nunderstanding of the world; it is also a set of practices used to establish, \nextend, and refine that knowledge. \u275a\n\nA Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas\nCopyright National Academy of Sciences.

Research suggests that personal interest, experience, and \nenthusiasm\u2014critical to children\u2019s learning of science at school or in other set-\ntings\u2014may also be linked to later educational and career choices [27-30]. Thus, \nin order for students to develop a sustained attraction to science and for them \nto appreciate the many ways in which it is pertinent to their daily lives, class-\nroom learning experiences in science need to connect with their own interests \nand experiences. \nAs a strategy for building on prior interest, the disciplinary core ideas identi-\nfied here are described not only with an eye toward the knowledge that students \nbring with them to school but also toward the kinds of questions they are likely to \n",
