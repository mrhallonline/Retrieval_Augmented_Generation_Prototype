## üìù Unit Outline

1. Title of the Unit: "Exploring Biological Sex, Gender, and Genetic Variations"
2. Anchoring Phenomenon: The existence of a spectrum of biological sex characteristics and gender identities, and the impact of genetic mutations on these characteristics.
3. Driving Question: How do biological sex and gender differ, and how can genetic mutations affect the development of sex characteristics and athletic performance?
4. Summary of the Storyline Arc: The unit begins by distinguishing between biological sex and gender, emphasizing the cultural and societal aspects of gender. It then delves into the role of genes in determining biological sex characteristics, exploring how mutations can lead to variations. The unit concludes by investigating how these characteristics may influence athletic performance, encouraging students to consider the implications for gender categories in sports.
5. List of Lesson Sets:
   - Lesson 1: Introduction to Biological Sex and Gender: Understanding the differences and societal implications.
   - Lesson 2: The Role of Genes in Sex Determination: Exploring the genetic basis of biological sex.
   - Lesson 3: Genetic Mutations and Variations: Examining how mutations can affect sex characteristics.
   - Lesson 4: Biological Sex Characteristics and Athletic Performance: Investigating the potential impacts on sports and competition.
   - Lesson 5: Reflecting on Gender Categories in Sports: Discussing the implications of biological sex characteristics for gender divisions in athletics.
6. NGSS Performance Expectations: 
   - HS-LS1-4: Use a model to illustrate the role of cellular division (mitosis) and differentiation in producing and maintaining complex organisms.
   - HS-LS3-1: Ask questions to clarify relationships about the role of DNA and chromosomes in coding the instructions for characteristic traits passed from parents to offspring.
7. Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts:
   - How did students' understanding of the difference between biological sex and gender evolve throughout the unit?
   - Did students demonstrate an understanding of how genetic mutations can affect sex characteristics?
   - How did students respond to the discussion of biological sex characteristics' impact on athletic performance?
   - How effectively did the unit promote inclusive participation and respect for diverse perspectives on gender?
   - How can I improve the unit to better reflect students' cultural identities and community experiences?
