1. Title of the Unit: "Ecosystems and Our Impact: A Local Perspective"

2. Anchoring Phenomenon: The observable changes in local ecosystems in Los Angeles due to human activities.

3. Driving Question: How do human activities impact local ecosystems in Los Angeles, and what can we do to mitigate these effects?

4. Summary of the storyline arc: This unit will begin with students observing and discussing changes in their local ecosystems, leading to an exploration of the causes and effects of these changes. Students will then investigate how human activities contribute to these changes and the potential impacts on biodiversity and sustainability. The unit will conclude with students proposing and evaluating potential solutions to mitigate these impacts, considering their feasibility and potential effectiveness in their local context.

5. Lesson Sets:
   - Lesson 1: Observing and Documenting Changes in Local Ecosystems: Students will observe and document changes in local ecosystems, drawing from personal experiences and local news stories.
   - Lesson 2: Understanding Ecosystems: Students will learn about the components of an ecosystem and how they interact, focusing on local examples.
   - Lesson 3: Human Impact on Ecosystems: Students will investigate how human activities, such as urban development, pollution, and resource consumption, impact local ecosystems.
   - Lesson 4: Biodiversity and Sustainability: Students will explore the concepts of biodiversity and sustainability, and how they are affected by human activities.
   - Lesson 5: Mitigating Human Impact: Students will propose and evaluate potential solutions to mitigate the impacts of human activities on local ecosystems, considering their feasibility and potential effectiveness.

6. NGSS Performance Expectations: MS-LS2-1, MS-LS2-2, MS-LS2-4, MS-ESS3-3, MS-ESS3-4

7. Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts:
   - How are students connecting the content to their own experiences and local context?
   - What strategies are effective in promoting inclusive participation and diverse ways of knowing in science?
