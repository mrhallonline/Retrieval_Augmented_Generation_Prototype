Students will learn about the role of chromosomes in determining biological sex and how genetic mutations can affect the development of sex characteristics. They will then investigate how these biological factors can influence athletic performance. The unit concludes with a discussion on societal perceptions of gender and how these can impact opportunities and expectations in athletics. Throughout the unit, students will be encouraged to consider their local context and the implications of these concepts on their community.\n",
