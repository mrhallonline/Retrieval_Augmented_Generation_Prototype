      "2. **Flexibility in Lesson Planning**: The NGSS provides detailed guidelines but allows for flexibility in lesson preparation. This means you can tailor the lessons to fit your state, school district, and specific classroom needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Building on Prior Knowledge**: Consider what students already know about the topic and how instruction can build on that knowledge. Identify prior concepts that are necessary for understanding the core ideas of the unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Level of Abstraction**: Determine the appropriate level of abstraction expected from students and ensure that the instruction is aligned with that level.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Use of Representations and Media**: Utilize various representations or media to help students make sense of core ideas. This can include visual aids, models, or digital resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Engagement in Scientific Practices**: Encourage students to engage in scientific practices to explore phenomena and understand the concepts being taught.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Crosscutting Concepts**: Integrate crosscutting concepts that can support learning the core ideas, helping students make connections across different areas of science.\n",

Since its \\ninception in 1928, NARST has promoted research in \\nscience education and the communication of \\nknowledge generated by the research. The ultimate goal \\nof NARST is to help all learners achieve science literacy.\\nThe Association is incorporated as a non-profit \\ncorporation in the State of Minnesota. The official \\npublication is the Journal of Research in Science \\nTeaching (JRST). NARST encourages presentations of \\na wide variety of investigations in all aspects of science \\neducation, including action, historical, philosophical, \\nethnographic, experimental, and evaluative research \\nstudies. Reports of empirical research, critical reviews, \\nand theoretical works are encouraged. In October \\n2010, to reflect the Association’s growing international \\nfocus and membership, the Board approved referring \\nto the Association by its acronym only. At the April 2011 \\nBoard Meeting, the tagline for the Association was \\napproved by the Board. Thus, the Association’s name \\nand tagline is: \\nNARST— A global organization for improving \\nscience education through research. \\nResearch areas of interest to NARST members include \\ncurriculum development and organization, assessment \\nand evaluation, learning theory, teacher education, \\nprograms for exceptional students (special needs and \\ntalents), equity studies, policy, and methods of teaching.\\nNARST Mission Statement\\nNARST is a global organization of professionals \\ncommitted to the improvement of science teaching \\nand learning through research. Since its inception \\nin 1928, NARST has promoted research in science \\neducation and the communication of knowledge \\ngenerated by the research.\\nThe ultimate goal of NARST is to help all learners \\nachieve science literacy. NARST promotes this goal \\nby: 1) encouraging and supporting the application of \\ndiverse research methods and theoretical perspectives \\nfrom multiple disciplines to the investigation of \\nteaching and learning in science; 2) communicating \\nscience education research findings to researchers, \\npractitioners, and policy makers; and 3) cooperating \\nwith other educational and scientific societies to \\ninfluence educational policies.\\nMember Benefits\\n•\\t Ten issues per year of the Journal of Research in \\nScience Teaching (electronic version), with access \\nto JRST online through Wiley InterScience.\\n•\\t Access to the NARST Member Forum. Stay \\nconnected and informed of NARST activities, \\nposition openings, committee and Research Interest \\nGroup events, graduate student events, and more.\\n•\\t Discounted registration rate for the NARST Annual \\nInternational Conference.\\n•\\t Opportunities to apply for scholarships and \\ntravel support.\\n•\\t Access to NARST Virtual Events throughout the \\nyear. We encourage members to propose webinars, \\nworkshops, and other virtual events that align with \\nNARST’s mission. Committees, RIGs, strands, and \\nNARST leadership offer events for members free of \\ncharge.\\n•\\t Opportunities to volunteer for committees and \\nleadership positions.\\n•\\t Opportunities to serve as a mentor for new \\nmembers and early career scholars: \\nSandra K. Abell Institute, \\nMentor/Mentee Nexus, and more.',\n",
