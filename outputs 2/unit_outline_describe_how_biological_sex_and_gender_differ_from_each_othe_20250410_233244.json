    "- How did students' understanding of the difference between biological sex and gender evolve throughout the unit?",
    "- In what ways did students apply their understanding of genetics to explain the development of sex characteristics?",
    "- How effectively did students use data to analyze the influence of biological sex and gender on athletic performance?",
    "- How did students demonstrate their understanding of inclusivity and fairness in their proposals for more equitable athletic competitions?"
