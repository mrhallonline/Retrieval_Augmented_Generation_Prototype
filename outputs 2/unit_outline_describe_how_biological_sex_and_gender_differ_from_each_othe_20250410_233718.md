1. Title of the Unit: "Unraveling the Threads of Sex, Gender, and Genetics: A Biological Perspective"

2. NGSS Anchoring Phenomenon: The observable differences in athletic performance between individuals of different biological sexes, and the influence of genetic mutations on the development of internal and external sex characteristics.

3. Driving Question: How do biological sex, gender, and genetic mutations influence the development of internal and external sex characteristics and athletic performance?

4. Summary of the Storyline Arc: The unit begins with an exploration of the concepts of biological sex and gender, emphasizing their distinct definitions and societal implications. Students then delve into the genetic basis of biological sex, investigating how chromosomes determine sex and how genetic mutations can influence sex characteristics. The unit then shifts to a discussion on how these biological differences can impact athletic performance, using real-world examples and data. Students will also explore the societal and cultural implications of these biological differences, particularly in the context of their rural community. The unit concludes with a synthesis of the concepts learned, and a reflection on the importance of understanding these biological and societal nuances.

5. Lesson Sets:
   - Lesson 1: Understanding Biological Sex and Gender: This lesson introduces the concepts of biological sex and gender, emphasizing their differences and societal implications.
   - Lesson 2: The Genetics of Sex: Students delve into the genetic basis of biological sex, exploring how chromosomes determine sex.
   - Lesson 3: Genetic Mutations and Sex Characteristics: This lesson focuses on how genetic mutations can influence the development of internal and external sex characteristics.
   - Lesson 4: Biological Sex and Athletic Performance: Students investigate how biological differences can impact athletic performance, using real-world examples and data.
   - Lesson 5: Societal and Cultural Implications: This lesson explores the societal and cultural implications of these biological differences, particularly in the context of their rural community.

6. Key Investigations:
   - Investigation 1: Exploring the Genetics of Sex: Students conduct a hands-on investigation to understand how chromosomes determine biological sex.
   - Investigation 2: Genetic Mutations and Sex Characteristics: Students analyze case studies of genetic mutations influencing sex characteristics.
   - Investigation 3: Athletic Performance and Biological Sex: Students analyze data and research studies on the impact of biological sex on athletic performance.

7. NGSS Performance Expectations: HS-LS1-4, HS-LS3-1, HS-LS3-2

8. Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts:
   - How did students demonstrate their understanding of the difference between biological sex and gender?
   - How effectively were students able to analyze and interpret data related to genetic mutations and athletic performance?
   - How did students connect the scientific concepts learned in this unit to their own lives and community context?
   - How did this unit promote inclusive participation and multiple ways of knowing in science?
   - How can I improve this unit to better reflect studentsâ€™ cultural identities or community experiences?
