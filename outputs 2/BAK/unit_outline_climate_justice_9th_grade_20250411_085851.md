1. Title of the Unit: "Climate Justice: Understanding and Addressing Climate Change in Oakland"

2. NGSS Anchoring Phenomenon: The observable changes in Oakland's climate and its impacts on the community, such as increased temperatures, air pollution, and extreme weather events.

3. Driving Question: "How does climate change impact our community in Oakland, and what can we do to promote climate justice?"

4. Summary of the Storyline Arc: The unit begins by exploring the local climate changes in Oakland, focusing on the observable phenomena such as increased temperatures and air pollution. Students will then investigate the causes of these changes, including human activities and their impact on the environment. They will also explore the concept of climate justice, understanding how climate change disproportionately affects different communities. The unit will then delve into the local implications of climate change, examining its effects on Oakland's community. Students will research and discuss potential solutions and actions that can be taken at the community level to address climate change and promote climate justice. The unit concludes with students developing a climate action plan for their school or community, incorporating their understanding of climate science and justice.

5. Lesson Sets:
   - Lesson Set 1: Understanding Climate Change - Students will learn about the science of climate change, focusing on the greenhouse effect and human activities that contribute to global warming.
