  "title_of_unit": "\"Unraveling the Threads: Biological Sex, Gender, and Genetic Mutations\"\n\n2. NGSS Anchoring Phenomenon: The differences between biological sex and gender, and the impact of genetic mutations on the development of internal and external sex characteristics.\n\n3. Driving Question: How do biological sex and gender differ, and how can mutations in various genes affect the development of sex characteristics and athletic performance?\n\n4. Summary of the storyline arc: The unit begins with an exploration of the concepts of biological sex and gender, highlighting the differences between them. Students will then delve into the role of genes in determining biological sex and the development of sex characteristics. They will investigate the process of cellular division (mitosis) and differentiation, and how genetic mutations can lead to variations in these characteristics. The unit will also address the impact of these characteristics on athletic performance, and how societal perceptions of gender can influence this. Throughout the unit, students will be encouraged to reflect on their own community's understanding of these concepts and the implications for social issues.\n\n5. Lesson Sets:\n   - Lesson Set 1: Introduction to Biological Sex and Gender: This lesson will explore the concepts of biological sex and gender, their differences, and societal implications.\n   - Lesson Set 2: Genes and Sex Characteristics: This lesson will delve into the role of genes in determining biological sex and the development of sex characteristics.\n   - Lesson Set 3: Genetic Mutations and Variations: This lesson will investigate genetic mutations and how they can lead to variations in sex characteristics.\n   - Lesson Set 4: Sex Characteristics and Athletic Performance: This lesson will explore the impact of sex characteristics on athletic performance.\n   - Lesson Set 5: Societal Perceptions and Implications: This lesson will discuss societal perceptions of gender and the implications for social issues.\n\n6. Key Investigations:\n   - Investigation 1: Exploring the Concepts of Biological Sex and Gender: Students will research and present on the concepts of biological sex and gender.\n   - Investigation 2: The Role of Genes in Sex Characteristics: Students will conduct experiments or simulations to understand the role of genes in determining sex characteristics.\n   - Investigation 3: Understanding Genetic Mutations: Students will analyze case studies or data sets to understand how genetic mutations can lead to variations in sex characteristics.\n   - Investigation 4: The Impact of Sex Characteristics on Athletic Performance: Students will analyze data or case studies to understand the impact of sex characteristics on athletic performance.\n\n7. NGSS Performance Expectations: HS-LS1-4, HS-LS3-1, HS-LS3-2\n\n8. Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts:\n   - How did the students respond to the concepts of biological sex and gender? Were there any misconceptions or biases that needed to be addressed?\n   - How effectively were students able to apply their understanding of genes and genetic mutations to the development of sex characteristics?\n   - How did students respond to the discussion on the impact of sex characteristics on athletic performance? Did they consider societal perceptions of gender in their discussions?\n   - How can this unit be improved to better reflect the students' cultural identities or community experiences?",
