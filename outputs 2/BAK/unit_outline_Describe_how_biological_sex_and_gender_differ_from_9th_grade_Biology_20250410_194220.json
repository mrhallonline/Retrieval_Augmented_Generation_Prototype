  "title_of_unit": "\"Understanding Biological Sex, Gender, and Genetic Mutations: A Biological Perspective\"\n\n2. NGSS Anchoring Phenomenon: The diversity of internal and external sex characteristics in humans and how they can be influenced by genetic mutations.\n\n3. Driving Question: How do biological sex and gender differ, and how can mutations in various genes affect the development of internal and external sex characteristics and potentially influence athletic performance?\n\n4. Summary of the storyline arc: The unit begins by exploring the concepts of biological sex and gender, highlighting their differences and societal implications. Students will then delve into the role of genes in determining internal and external sex characteristics, with a focus on how mutations can lead to variations. The unit will then shift to the impact of these characteristics on athletic performance, using real-world examples and data. Throughout the unit, students will engage in hands-on activities, discussions, and investigations that encourage critical thinking and application of knowledge. The unit will conclude with a project where students will apply their understanding to a real-world scenario in their local community.\n\n5.

List of 3–5 Key Investigations:\n   - Investigation 1: Exploring Genetic Mutations - Students will conduct a hands-on activity to understand how genetic mutations can lead to variations in sex characteristics.\n   - Investigation 2: Analyzing Athletic Performance - Students will analyze data on athletic performance to understand how sex characteristics can influence this.\n   - Investigation 3: Community Project - Students will apply their understanding to a real-world scenario in their local community, promoting relevance and application of knowledge.\n\n7. NGSS Performance Expectations: HS-LS1-4, HS-LS3-1, HS-LS3-2\n\n8. Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts:\n   - How did students demonstrate understanding of the difference between biological sex and gender?\n   - Were students able to articulate how genetic mutations can affect sex characteristics?\n   - How effectively were students able to apply their understanding to real-world scenarios, particularly in their local community context?\n   - How did the unit promote inclusive participation and multiple ways of knowing in science?\n   - How could the unit be improved to better reflect students’ cultural identities or community experiences?",
