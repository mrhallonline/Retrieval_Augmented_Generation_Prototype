1. Title of the Unit: "Unraveling the Complexities: Biological Sex, Gender, and Genetic Mutations"

2. NGSS Anchoring Phenomenon: The observable differences in athletic performance between individuals of different biological sexes and the influence of genetic mutations on the development of internal and external sex characteristics.

3. Driving Question: How do biological sex, gender, and genetic mutations influence individual characteristics and capabilities, and what role do they play in our society?

4. Summary of the Storyline Arc: This unit begins by exploring the concepts of biological sex and gender, highlighting their differences and societal implications. Students will then delve into the role of genes in determining biological sex, and how mutations can affect the development of sex characteristics. The unit will use local examples, such as the athletic performance of community members, to illustrate these concepts. Students will investigate how these genetic factors can influence athletic performance, and discuss the societal implications. The unit concludes with a critical examination of how our understanding of these biological concepts can inform and challenge societal norms and expectations.

5. Lesson Sets:
   - Lesson 1: Understanding Biological Sex and Gender: This lesson introduces the concepts of biological sex and gender, emphasizing their differences and societal implications.
   - Lesson 2: The Role of Genes in Determining Biological Sex: Students will explore the genetic basis of biological sex, and how it influences the development of sex characteristics.
   - Lesson 3: Genetic Mutations and Sex Characteristics: This lesson delves into how genetic mutations can affect the development of internal and external sex characteristics.
   - Lesson 4: The Influence of Biological Sex on Athletic Performance: Students will investigate how biological sex can influence athletic performance, using local examples.
   - Lesson 5: Societal Implications and Reflection: This lesson encourages students to critically examine societal norms and expectations in light of their understanding of biological sex, gender, and genetic mutations.

6. Key Investigations:
   - Investigation 1: Exploring the Genetic Basis of Biological Sex: Students will examine karyotypes to understand the genetic basis of biological sex.
   - Investigation 2: Studying Genetic Mutations and Sex Characteristics: Students will use case studies to explore how genetic mutations can affect the development of sex characteristics.
   - Investigation 3: Investigating the Influence of Biological Sex on Athletic Performance: Students will analyze data on local athletic performances to understand the influence of biological sex.

7. NGSS Performance Expectations: HS-LS1-4, HS-LS3-1, HS-LS3-2

8. Suggested Teacher Reflection Prompts:
   - How did students respond to the exploration of biological sex and gender? What misconceptions did they have, and how were they addressed?
   - How effectively did students apply their understanding of genetics to the concept of biological sex and the influence of genetic mutations?
   - How did students engage with the societal implications of these biological concepts? What insights did they share, and what challenges did they identify?
