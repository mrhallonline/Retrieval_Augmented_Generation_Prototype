They then explore the concepts of biological sex and gender, understanding that while they are often used interchangeably, they are distinct. Students will learn about the role of chromosomes in determining biological sex and how genetic mutations can affect the development of sex characteristics. They will then investigate how these biological factors can influence athletic performance. The unit concludes with a discussion on societal perceptions of gender and how these can impact opportunities and expectations in athletics. Throughout the unit, students will be encouraged to consider their local context and the implications of these concepts on their community.\n",

They will investigate how these environmental changes disproportionately affect marginalized communities, particularly in urban areas like Oakland. Through a series of investigations, students will analyze data, engage with community members, and explore historical and current social justice movements. The unit will culminate in students designing and proposing actionable solutions to promote climate justice in their community, integrating scientific understanding with social and political action.
